Published in 1854, it details Thoreau’s life for two years, two months, and two days around the shores of Walden Pond. Walden is neither a novel nor a true autobiography, but a social critique of the Western World, with each chapter heralding some aspect of humanity that needed to be either renounced or praised. Along with his critique of the civilized world, Thoreau examines other issues afflicting man in society, ranging from economy and reading to solitude and higher laws. He also takes time to talk about the experience at Walden Pond itself, commenting on the animals and the way people treated him for living there, using those experiences to bring out his philosophical positions. This extended commentary on nature has often been interpreted as a strong statement to the natural religion that transcendentalists like Thoreau and Emerson were preaching.

Read by Ruth Golding.A collection of twelve short stories featuring Conan Doyle's legendary detective, originally published as single stories in Strand Magazine and subsequently collected into a single volume.There is not always a crime committed nor a culprit to find, and when there is, Holmes does not invariably get his man. However, his extraordinary powers of deduction generally solve the mystery, often to the discomfiture of the official police force. Holmes is a man of many facets, and I do not share the common perception of Holmes as cold and humourless: his sense of fun can be sparkling, and there are moments of rare pathos.

Read by Denny Sayers.Daniel Defoe's The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner (1719) is considered by many the first English novel. Based on the real-life experiences of the castaway Alexander Selkirk, the book has had a perrenial appeal among readers of all ages - especially the young adult reading public - who continue to find inspiration in the inventive resourcefulness of its hero, sole survivor of a shipwreck who is marooned on an uninhabited island.Especially poignant, after more than two decades of unbroken solitude, is the affection that Robinson develops for Friday, another survivor fleeing certain death at the hands of enemy tribesmen from the South American continent.

The poem is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, and concerns the events that befall the Greek hero Odysseus in his long journey back to his native land Ithaca after the fall of Troy.It takes Odysseus ten years to return to his native land of Ithaca after ten years of war; during his 20-year absence, his son Telemachus and his wife Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors who have moved into Odysseus’ home to compete for Penelope’s hand in marriage, since most have assumed that Odysseus has died.The poem is a fundamental text in the Western canon and continues to be read in both Homeric Greek and translations around the world.(Summary from Wikipedia)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (167MB)Download M4B Part 2 (161MB)Oct 26, 2012 - Normalized volumes on files to fix large volume discrepancies.\n","cover":"https://ia802307.us.archive.org/30/items/odyssey_butler_librivox/The_Odyssey_1005.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-03-12 10:28:07","Boxid":"OL100020216","Identifier":"odyssey_butler_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"11:18:25","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 01","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_01_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 02","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_02_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 03","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_03_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 04","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_04_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 05","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_05_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 06","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_06_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 07","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_07_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 08","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_08_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 09","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_09_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 10","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_10_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 11","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_11_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 12","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_12_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 13","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_13_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 14","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_14_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 15","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_15_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 16","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_16_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 17","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_17_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 18","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_18_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 19","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_19_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 20","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_20_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 21","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_21_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 22","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_22_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 23","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_23_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 24","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_24_homer_butler.mp3"}]},{"title":"Anne of Green Gables","author":"Lucy Maud Montgomery","description":"Librivox recording of Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery.Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic children's novel, Anne of Green Gables tells the story of a red headed orphan girl with a personality you can't help but love.

Translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.    The Divine Comedy (Italian: Commedia, later christened “Divina” by Giovanni Boccaccio), written by Dante Alighieri between 1308 and his death in 1321, is widely considered the central epic poem of Italian literature, the last great work of literature of the Middle Ages and the first great work of the Renaissance. A culmination of the medieval world-view of the afterlife, it establishes the Tuscan dialect in which it is written as the Italian standard, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature.The Divine Comedy is composed of three canticas (or “cantiche”) — Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise) — composed each of 33 cantos (or “canti”). The very first canto serves as an introduction to the poem and is generally not considered to be part of the first cantica, bringing the total number of cantos to 100.The poet tells in the first person his travel through the three realms of the dead, lasting during the Easter Triduum in the spring of 1300.For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit LibriVox.org.

The novel is nominally about the obsessive hunt by the crazed Captain Ahab of the book's eponymous white whale. But interspersed in that story are digressions, paradoxes, philosophical riffs on whaling and life, and a display of techniques so advanced for its time that some have referred to the 1851 Moby Dick as the first \"modern\" novel.

The story begins as the Invisible Man, with a bandaged face and a heavy coat and gloves, takes a train to lodge in a country inn whilst he tries to discover the antidote and make himself visible again. The book inspired several films and is notable for its vivid descriptions of the invisible man--no mean feat, given that you can't see him!

Read by Mark F. Smith.In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain creates an entertaining adventure of Middle America in the 1800's - afloat on a raft on the Mississippi River. Huck escapes his civilized life when he arranges his own \"murder\" and turns back into the backwoods, downriver yokel he started as, and in the process springing a slave, Jim, from bondage.Huck and Jim experience life as a series of tableaus as the river sweeps them through small towns on their way South. At each stop, Huck engages his talent for mixing fact with bald-faced lies to endlessly get himself out of situations... and of course, putting him into others!Much has been written about the statement Twain is making about slavery in this book, but it's really secondary to the story. The facts of how black people were treated in this period give Huck and Jim their license for life on the run. Modern listeners will be intrigued by the unencumbered life of the pair; they make do with coffee, fish from the river, and little else (but of course, when they do need something extra, they don't mind helping themselves to it without recourse to money!)Huck and Jim have run-ins with desperados and family feuds and even manage to get run down by a steamboat. The adventures ratchet up when they are joined on the raft by a self-proclaimed \"duke\" and a \"king\" - shysters both, who spend their time in figuring how to fleece the public in the little river towns. And when Jim is captured and threatened with being sent back into slavery, Huck enlists his old buddy Tom Sawyer in a frenzied, desperate, and terribly funny rescue.I had to clip a lot of laughing from this recording at Twain's sly, catch-'em-when-they're-not-looking humor, but you can feel free to enjoy some good belly laughs at this crew of lovable rapscallions!

It is considered a classic of children's literature and has spawned many derivative works of art, such as Disney's classic 1940 animated movie of the same name, and commonplace ideas, such as a liar's long nose.(Summary from Wikipedia)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the

Expectations, read by Mark F. Smith. This classic tale tells of an orphan, Pip, who through a series of strange circumstances first finds a trade as a blacksmith's apprentice and then learns that he has \"great expectations\" of a future inheritance from an anonymous benefactor. He soon learns to live the profligate life of a gentleman as he gradually sheds his associations with the gentle souls of his past, Joe (the blacksmith) and Biddy (a level-headed young lady). He throws his money at improving the prospects of his roommate and friend Herbert and his heart at an \"ice princess\" whose heart will never respond. But then an escaped convict from his distant past comes calling, and all Pip's hopes dissolve. (Summary by Mark F.

Take a family with five unmarried daughters and a lack of wealth, throw in a new wealthy neighbor or two, plus a whole regiment of soldiers in town, and add a heaping spoonful of pride and a pinch of prejudice. Mix it all together and you get a story full of tears and laughter, embarrassment and pride, and, of course, love.

It is considered to be one of the most characteristic examples of the \"literary nonsense\" genre, and its narrative course and structure have been enormously influential, especially in the fantasy genre.

Smith.    The Swiss Family Robinson has delighted generations of readers with its exciting tale of a family which, though shipwrecked, displays “the right stuff” and builds a charming colony that later, they do not want to leave. Cut off from the comforts and companionship of other humans, they use a familiarity with natural history and biology to find the resources and build the tools to construct a canoe, weave cloth, irrigate a garden, and turn an immense hollow tree into a lofty house with a spiral staircase. They domesticate buffaloes, wild asses, and monkeys. They establish farms and plantations. And finally, they have a terrifying encounter with natives from a nearby island.    Johann David Wyss, the author, did not live to complete his tale. Storytellers over the years have injected so many episodes into the various versions that probably none closely match the original. (Indeed, the Baroness de Montholieu expanded the book from two volumes into five when she translated it into French.) This effort was re-translated into English in 1849 by W.H.G. Kingston, abridging the edition severely. It follows the British sensibilities of the period in terms of sentence structure and emphasis. (Summary by Mark F.

Read by Elizabeth Klett.Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's classic comic romance, in which the five Bennett sisters try to find that most elusive creature: a single man in possession of a large fortune.  Sparks fly when sweet, pretty Jane meets their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley, but her sister Elizabeth is most offended by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy.  This is Austen at the height of her powers: the ironic narration, hilariously drawn supporting characters, and romantic suspense make this her most enduringly popular novel.

It is widely held to be one of Dickens’ finest and most complete novels, containing one of the most vast, complex and engaging arrays of minor characters and sub-plots in his entire canon. Dickens tells all of these both through the narrative of the novel’s heroine, Esther Summerson, and as an omniscient narrator. Memorable characters include the menacing lawyer Tulkinghorn, the friendly but depressive John Jarndyce and the childish Harold Skimpole. The plot concerns a long-running legal dispute (Jarndyce and Jarndyce) which has far-reaching consequences for all involved.(Summary from Wikipedia)For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B part 1 (228MB)Download M4B part 2 (208MB)Download M4B part 3 (233MB)Download M4B part 4 (182MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800709.us.archive.org/13/items/bleak_house_cl_librivox/Bleak_House_1003.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2008-01-23 05:04:58","Boxid":"OL100020109","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-27T05:32:31Z","Identifier":"bleak_house_cl_librivox","Runtime":"43:30:19","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2008          ","audios":[{"title":"01 -

Stowe was a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active abolitionist. The novel is believed to have had a profound effect on the North’s view of slavery. In fact, when he met Harriet Beecher Stowe, President Lincoln is said to have commented, \"So you're the little lady whose book started the Civil War.\" First published on March 20, 1852, the story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave, the central character around whose life the other characters—both fellow slaves and slave owners—revolve. The novel depicts the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that Christian love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings. (Summary by Wikipedia and John Greenman)Note From the Reader: The listener is about to enter a world rich with diverse characters. In order to differentiate between the characters, the reader has given each, his/her own voice. As an adult male reader, however, the reader’s representation of women and children will, necessarily be less than adequate. He asks for your indulgence.

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain. Read by Annie Coleman. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) by Mark Twain is one of the truly great American novels, beloved by children, adults, and literary critics alike. The book tells the story of \"Huck\" Finn (first introduced as Tom Sawyer's sidekick in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer), his friend Jim, and their journey down the Mississippi River on a raft. Both are on the run, Huck from his drunk and abusive father, and Jim as a runaway slave.As Huck and Jim drift down the river, they meet many colorful characters and have many great adventures. The true heart of the story, however, is the friendship between Huck and Jim. A constant theme throughout the book is Huck's internal struggle between what he has been taught, that helping a runaway slave is a sin, and what he truly believes, that Jim is a good man and it couldn't possibly be wrong to help him.Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was unique at the time of its publication (1884) because it is narrated by Huck himself and is written in the numerous dialects common in the area and time in which the book is set. Although the book was originally intended as a sequel to the children's book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, as Twain wrote Adventures of Huckleberry Finn it progressed into a more serious work. Twain's views on slavery and other social issues of the time become clear through the words, thoughts, and actions of Huck Finn. The book has always been the subject of great controversy, and according to The American Library Association it was fifth on the list of most frequently challenged books in the 1990s.(Summary by Annie Coleman) For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

It is often considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas's most popular work. The writing of the work was completed in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815–1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. It is primarily concerned with themes of justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness, and is told in the style of an adventure story.

Read by Karen Savage.Pride and Prejudice is the most famous of Jane Austen’s novels, and its opening is one of the most famous lines in English literature - “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” Its manuscript was first written between 1796 and 1797, and was initially called First Impressions, but was never published under that title. Following revisions it was published on 28 January 1813 by the same Mr. Egerton of the Military Library, Whitehall, who had brought out Sense and Sensibility. Like both its predecessor and Northanger Abbey, it was written at Steventon Rectory.

Read by Cori Samuel.Love and Freindship [sic] is a juvenile story by Jane Austen, dated 1790, when Austen was 14 years old. Love and Freindship (the misspelling is one of many in the story) is clearly a parody of romantic novels Austen read as a child. This is clear even from the subtitle, \"Deceived in Freindship and Betrayed in Love,\" which neatly undercuts the title.Written in epistolary form, it resembles a fairy tale as much as anything else, featuring wild coincidences and turns of fortune, but Austen is determined to lampoon the conventions of romantic stories, right down to the utter failure of romantic fainting spells, which always turn out dreadfully for the female characters.In this story one can see the development of Austen's sharp wit and disdain for romantic sensibility, so characteristic of her later novels.Summary revised from Wikipedia by Cori Samuel.

Read by Chere Theriot.Anthem is a dystopic science fiction story taking place at some unspecified future date. Mankind has entered another dark age as a result of what Rand saw as the weaknesses of socialistic thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully planned (when it is allowed to occur, if at all) and the concept of individuality has been eliminated (for example, the word \"I\" has disappeared from the language). As is common in her work, Rand draws a clear distinction between the \"socialist/communal\" values of equality and brotherhood and the \"productive/capitalist\" values of achievement and individuality. The story also parallels Stalinist Russia, which was currently going on at the time as the story was published.

Why settle down to some humdrum uncongenial billet, when excitement, romance, danger and a decent living were all going begging together?” - A. J. Raffles, The Ides of March.\n\nThe Amateur Cracksman is the first collection of stories about A. J. Raffles, gentleman, cricketer, and thief. After stopping his old school friend, Bunny Manders, from a desperate attempt at suicide, Raffles introduces the unsuspecting Bunny to a new way of earning a living, burglary. Though frequently horrified by Raffles's actions, the conscience-stricken Bunny stands by him through all their adventures, firm to his promise, “When you want me, I'm your man!” (Summary by Kristin Hughes)\n\nFor more information on our readers, please visit the catalog pageDownload M4B (147MB)\n","cover":"https://ia802701.us.archive.org/29/items/amateur_cracksman_librivox/Amateur_Cracksman_1004.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-10-20 19:00:50","Boxid":"OL100020204","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-09T14:40:41Z","Identifier":"amateur_cracksman_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"5:25:24","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"01 - The Ides of March","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_01_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"02 - A Costume Piece","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_02_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"03 - Gentlemen and Players","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_03_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"04 - Le Premier Pas","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_04_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"05 - Wilful Murder","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_05_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"06 - Nine Points of the Law","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_06_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"07 - The Return Match","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_07_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"08 - The Gift of the Emperor","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_08_hornung.mp3"}]},{"title":"How to Speak and Write Correctly","author":"Joseph Devlin","description":"LibriVox recording of How to Speak and Write Correctly, by Joseph Devlin.Read by Librivox volunteers.This is a 1910 guide for those who wish to learn how to correctly (though maybe not \"properly\") create sentences, use figures of speech, write letters, and more, all while choosing the right words and doing it with style.

In this popular American book from the 1920s, accomplished public speaker and self-help charlatan Elsie Lincoln Benedict outlines her pseudo-scientific system of \"Human Analysis\". She proposes that, within the human race, five sub-types have developed through evolutionary processes, each with its own distinct character traits and corresponding outward appearance. She offers to teach the reader how to recognise these five types of people and understand their innate differences. Her ideas have never been taken seriously by the scientific community, but this book is considered a classic within its genre and remains in print today.

Translated by Benjamin Jowett.Read by Kevin Johnson.As Jowett relates in his brilliant introduction, 95% of Plato's writing is certain and his reputation rests soundly on this foundation. The Alcibiades 1 appears to be a short work by Plato with only two characters: Socrates and Alcibiades. This dialogue has little dramatic verisimilitude but centres on the question of what knowledge one needs for political life. Like the early dialogues, the question is on whether the virtues needed by a statesman can be taught, on the importance of self-knowledge as a starting point for any leader. While this may be only partially the work of Plato, or even not his at all, Jowett favoured the work with his magisterial translation and appears to favour its inclusion in the canon of true works.

Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass exalted the body and the material world.Whitman was inspired to begin Leaves of Grass after reading an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson which expressed a need for a uniquely American poet.  When the book was first published, Whitman sent a copy to Emerson, whose praiseful letter of response helped launch the book to success.  Whitman's hero, Abraham Lincoln, read and enjoyed an early version of Leaves of Grass.  Despite such high recommendations, Whitman faced charges of obscenity and immorality for his work, but this only led to increased popularity of the book.Whitman continually revised and republished Leaves of Grass throughout his lifetime, notably adding the \"Drum-Taps\" section after Lincoln's assassination.  The book grew from 12 poems in its first publication, which Whitman paid for and typeset himself, to nearly 400 poems in its final, \"Death Bed Edition.\"  This recording is of the final edition.(Summary adapted from wikipedia.org by Annie Coleman)For more information on our readers, see our catalog page: http://librivox.org/leaves-of-grass-by-walt-whitman/For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.orgDownload M4B Part 1 (270MB)Download M4B Part 2 (196MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800901.us.archive.org/30/items/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_of_grass_itemimage.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-03-16 02:09:04","Boxid":"OL100020513","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-31T23:11:12Z","Identifier":"leaves_of_grass_librivox","Runtime":"19:16:02","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"Book 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_01_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_02_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 3, Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_03.1_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 3, Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_03.2_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 3, Part 3","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_03.3_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 3, Part 4","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_03.4_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 4","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_04_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 5","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_05_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 6-7","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_06-07_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 8-10","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_08-10_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 11-12","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_11-12_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 13","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_13_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 14","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_14_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 15","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_15_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 16","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_16_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 17","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_17_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 18","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_18_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 19","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_19_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 20","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_20_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 21, Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_21.1_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 21, Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_21.2_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 22","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_22_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 23","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_23_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 24, Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_24.1_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 24, Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_24.2_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 25","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_25_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 26","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_26_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 27-28","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_27-28_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 29-30","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_29-30_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 31","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_31_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 32","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_32_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 33","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_33_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 34","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_34_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 35","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_35_whitman.mp3"}]},{"title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (dramatic reading)","author":"Lewis Carroll","description":"LibriVox recording of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.

Read by JD.\n\nThe Gods of Mars is a 1918 Edgar Rice Burroughs science fiction novel, the second of his famous Barsoom series. It can be said that the novel set the tone for much science fiction to come. Its influence can clearly be seen in franchises such as Star Trek and Farscape. While Burroughs no doubt borrowed liberally from the pulp fiction of his day, particularly westerns and swashbuckling tales, the pacing and themes set the tone for the soft science fiction genre.The protagonist, John Carter, with his proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and flirtations with beautiful alien women, could be said to have set the mold for later influential icons like Captain James T. Kirk and James Bond.At the end of the first book, A Princess of Mars, John Carter is unwillingly transported back to Earth. The Gods of Mars begins with his arrival back on Barsoom (Mars) after a ten year hiatus, separated from his wife Dejah Thoris, his unborn child, and the Red Martian people of the nation of Helium, whom he has adopted as his own. Unfortunately, John Carter materializes in the one place on Barsoom from which nobody is allowed to depart: the Valley Dor, which is the Barsoomian heaven.

Read in English by Bob Gonzalez; ToddHW; CaprishaPage; Lucretia B.; Libby Gohn; Marie Hoffman Who was John Milton? The author of Paradise Lost you say? Well, certainly, but he was also a man, going about his daily life like any of us in 17th century England, (except that he was a genius of course). Take time to read about a day in his life and learn more about him and his likes, dislikes, background and proclivities. Also, the same with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Walt Witman, Lord Byron, Keats and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Each of them a man or woman of their times, living each day like us, but seeing shades and hues of life that we can only experience through their exquisite poetry. These are meant by the author to be brief biographies with examples of their works and some insights into their common foibles as humans in addition to human geniuses. If you love to read poetry, you will enjoy reading these short bios which contain much of their best poetry in them. The selections are from 6 stand alone sources but Browning is part of another book and the link below is to that directly.

When she sees a White Rabbit as it runs through the tall grass (looking worriedly at the watch it takes from its waist-coat pocket), she runs after it and drops into a strange dream. The world is full of chatty animals, from a rather stand-offish hookah-smoking caterpillar to the friendly Cheshire Cat which only sometimes goes to the bother of having a body. And everyone seems to be ordering her about ... or telling her to recite poetry! ... and all those verses that she once knew so well seem strangely distorted.  In this book and in \"Through the Looking Glass\", Lewis Carroll affectionately brought together many of the wonderful stories he told to Alice and her sisters on long summer boating trips.

Salió a la venta en enero de 1605 con numerosas erratas, a causa de la celeridad que imponía el contrato de edición. Esta edición se reimprimió en el mismo año y en el mismo taller, de forma que hay en realidad dos ediciones de 1605 ligeramente distintas. Se sospecha, sin embargo, que existió una novela más corta, que sería una de sus futuras Novelas ejemplares.

The most important of these was the unification and militarization of Germany. The story, written in a semi-documentary style, is told in the first person by an unnamed observer. It tells of the events which happen mostly in London and the county of Surrey, England, when a number of vessels manned by aliens are fired from Mars and land on Earth.

Read in English by a full cast. Growing up on the banks of the Mississippi river, a mischievous boy named Tom Sawyer spends his days getting into one scrape after another. Tom's constant cleverness, superstition, trickery, and daring make him a handful to raise, and his Aunt Polly declares that she has \"never seen the beat of that boy!\" Tom is essentially good-hearted, however, but when he is witness to a horrible crime, his courage and integrity are tested beyond anything he ever expected. A note to parents: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is considered a children's classic, but contains racial slurs which, although \"acceptable\" in the time and place of the story's setting, will likely offend modern listeners.

Read by Michael Sirois.This novel (original French title -- L'Île des Pingouins) is a satire on human nature. The first publication was in 1908. These penguins are mistaken for humans by the 97-year-old priest, Father Mael, because of his bad eyesight. He baptizes them, and once baptized, they have no choice but to become human. They take on human traits (build civilizations, go to war, etc.). The book is very funny and powerful.

Vonnegut, Jr.","description":"LibriVox recording of 2 B R 0 2 B & The Big Trip Up Yonder, by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Read by Phil ChenevertThese two stories by Kurt Vonnegut were written almost a decade apart but they are definitely connected. The Big Trip Up Yonder, published in Galaxy Science Fiction January 1954 is a comical yet scary description of what over population was going to do to society after aging was conquered and a simple daily dose of \"anti-gerosone\" would keep you forever the same age. Would Gramps EVER take 'That Big Trip Up Yonder', or would his hordes of descendants be stuck with him forever in a tiny apartment!? 2 B R 0 2 B, published in Worlds of If, January 1962 takes this basic situation many years into the future and a solution has been found. The population of the US has dropped from 40 billion to 40 million. Not what everyone would call a pretty solution, or perhaps the best solution, but nevertheless a solution to the population problem. I believe this is the type of story it is best to listen to, not describe, so enjoy.

Read by Ruth Golding.Emily Brontë's only novel, published in 1847 under the pseudonym Ellis Bell, tells the tale of the all-encompassing and passionate, yet thwarted, love between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and how this unresolved passion eventually destroys them and many around them.Now considered a classic of English literature, Wuthering Heights met with mixed reviews by critics when it first appeared, with many horrified by the stark depictions of mental and physical cruelty. Though Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre was originally considered the best of the Brontë sisters' works, many subsequent critics of Wuthering Heights argued that its originality and achievement made it superior.

Conrad based the work closely on his own terrible experience in the Congo.This work has been reinterpreted and adapted into many modern forms, the most well known being the film Apocalypse Now.(Summary written by Marlo Dianne)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit Librivox.orgDownload M4B (119MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800205.us.archive.org/2/items/heart_of_darkness/Heart_of_Darkness.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-03-11 18:19:41","Album":"Heart of Darkness","Artist":"Joseph Conrad","Boxid":"OL100020302","External-identifier":"\n              urn:mb_releasegroup_id:5f5ca70a-3aa2-425e-8810-65caec26cc53          \n              urn:mb_release_id:83d8520e-36de-4cd0-998b-f819f28bd00e          \n              urn:upc:          ","Identifier":"heart_of_darkness","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"4:10:12","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"Chapter 1 Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_1a_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 1 Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_1b_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 2 Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_2a_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 2 Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_2b_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 3 Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_3a_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 3 Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_3b_conrad.mp3"}]},{"title":"Las Fábulas de Esopo, vol. 01","author":"Townsend, George Fyler; tr.

Little Women is the classic story of the March family, which consists of Mr. and Mrs. March and their four girls--practical, yet fashion conscious, Meg, who longs for the nice things they used to have. Rambunctious, book worm, Jo, who wants to become a writer and wishes she were born a boy. Shy and quiet, home-loving Beth, who loves to play the piano and play with her kitties. Finally, the youngest, artistic Amy, who longs for an aristocratic nose!The story takes place during the American Civil War, and begins with Mr. March away from home as a chaplain to the Union army, while his wife and daughters remain at home to work and wait for his safe return.  This book follows their joys and sorrows and scrapes along the path to the girl's becoming grown up \"little women\". Many of the scrapes they get into include Laurie--their harum scarum next door neighbor, who becomes their adopted brother. The two families, the March's and the Laurence's strike up a lasting friendship, despite their differences in material possessions.

Die hier vorliegenden Versionen entsprechen aber stärker den originalen, teils drastischen Fassungen.(Zusammenfassung von Rainer)For further information, including links to online text, reader

G. Wells","description":"Librivox recording of The War of the Worlds, by H. G. Wells.\n\nFor more information on our readers, see our catalog page: http://librivox.org/the-war-of-the-worlds-by-h-g-wells-group/\n\nH. G. Wells wrote The War of the Worlds in 1898, when there was much speculation about life on the planet Mars. The book is considered to be one of the first science fiction novels.  In the story, an English gentleman narrates the events of a violent and fast paced Martian invasion.The frightening images of people fleeing from gigantic tripod machines and the prospect of life under Martial rule have served as a bottomless well of inspiration for popular culture.  The novel has served as a template for many derivative or inspired works, including comics, countless books, a tv series, several films, a bestselling musical, and the famous Orson Wells broadcast. Overall, The War of the Worlds has become an early milestone in and inspiration for the invasion genre.The novel demonstrates Wells' typical pessimistic outlook on human nature and offers a good deal of critisism on society and people's ignorance and vanity. The War of the Worlds can be read as an indictment of European colonial actions around the globe at that time - with which the injustice of the Martian invasion can be compared.  Wells has since been credited with predicting quite a number of technologies, such as laser-like rays, industrial robot-like machines, and chemical-warfare.(Summary by Stephan Möbius and Annie Coleman)\n\nM4B audio book\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org\n","cover":"https://ia800707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_worlds_group_1109.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-05-03 22:59:07","Boxid":"OL100020214","Identifier":"war_of_the_worlds_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"6:43:20","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"The War of the Worlds -

Collodi","description":"A Librivox recording of Le avventure di Pinocchio by C. Collodi.Read in Italian by Simona.Le avventure di Pinocchio. Storia di un burattino è il titolo del romanzo ottocentesco che ha come protagonista un notissimo personaggio di finzione, appunto Pinocchio, burattino di legno al centro di celeberrime avventure. Si tratta di un classico della cosiddetta letteratura per ragazzi e fu scritto nel 1881 da Collodi (pseudonimo dello scrittore Carlo Lorenzini).Il personaggio di Pinocchio - burattino umanizzato nella tendenza a nascondersi dietro facili menzogne e a cui cresce il naso in rapporto ad ogni bugia che dice - è stato fatto proprio con il tempo anche dal mondo del cinema e da quello dei fumetti. Sulla sua figura sono stati inoltre realizzati album musicali e allestimenti teatrali in forma di musical.Nelle intenzioni di Collodi pare non vi fosse quella di creare un racconto per l’infanzia: nella prima versione, infatti, il burattino moriva, impiccato a causa dei suoi innumerevoli errori. Solo nelle versioni successive, pubblicate a puntate su un quotidiano (il Giornale per bambini), la storia venne modificata con il classico finale che oggi si conosce, con il burattino che assume le fattezze di un ragazzo in carne ed ossa.(Summary from Wikipedia)For further information, including links to M4B audio book, online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if

A modern and honest novel of chance and choice, faith and infidelities, this dark story asks what is free will and what is fate? What is the true nature of nature, and how do we fit together? Can we fit together?A tragedy set in the barren land of Edgon Heath. Our heroine, Eustacia, is proud, passionate, cruel, fickle, avaricious, and desperate. She burns every life she touches, never able to find the mad love and exotic world she dreams of. Our supposed hero, Clym, is modest, steady, plain, moral, and dutiful. He is satisfied returning from Paris to the simple comfort of home.When they come together, the Heath will come apart.Originally released as five books, in classic tragic form, a sixth, tacking on a \"happy ending,\" was added by editor and public pressure.

Schoolcraft and retold by William Trowbridge Larned\n\nRead by Chip\n\nWith no written language, Native Americans living in the Lake Superior region passed their cultural identity down through the generations by way of stories. Far more than mere tales to amuse children, they passed along the collective wisdom of the tribes. In the 1830s, government Indian Agent and ethnologist Henry R Schoolcraft learned the language of these people and went out to collect and preserve their stories before the tribes disappeared under the westward rush of American civilization. Though these stories were recast as children's fairy tales in the 1920s, they contain much of the old wisdom of a culture which has largely disappeared.

Read by Mark F. Smith.A story of castaways, similar to Robinson Crusoe and The Swiss Family Robinson, this book details the escape from Civil War-era Richmond, Virginia, of five Northern men who dared to go aloft in a balloon in the midst of a hurricane. Deposited on a lonely island in the Pacific, they make do with Yankee ingenuity where Chance has left them nothing. Only later do they find they have a hidden benefactor: Captain Nemo, of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, who resides, alone, secretly on the island. In time, the tiny colony becomes so prosperous that it is able to rescue another castaway from an island a hundred miles away. But all their work will come to naught - their island's volcano is about to awake!(Summary by Mark)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audio books, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit LibriVox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (197MB)Download M4B Part 2 (191MB)Download M4B Part 3 (186MB)\n","cover":"https://ia802701.us.archive.org/29/items/mysterious_island_ms_librivox/mysterious_island.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-05-10 22:52:26","Boxid":"OL100020303","Identifier":"mysterious_island_ms_librivox","Runtime":"21:58:03","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"1-01 The Storm of 1865.

Jahrhunderts begannen die Brüder Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm, traditionelle, bisher vor allem mündlich weitergegebene Erzählungen zusammenzutragen. Diese Sammlung ist als die Märchen der Gebrüder Grimm weltbekannt geworden und umfaßt so berühmte Geschichten wie Rapunzel, Hänsel und Gretel, Rumpelstilzchen, Rotkäppchen und viele andere. Diese Märchen wurden später stark editiert und 'beschönt'. Die hier vorliegenden Versionen entsprechen aber stärker den originalen, teils drastischen Fassungen.(Zusammenfassung von Rainer)For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit

Three Musketeers","author":"Alexandre Dumas","description":"Librivox recording of The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. Read by LibriVox Volunteers. The Three Musketeers (Les Trois Mousquetaires) is a novel by Alexandre Dumas, père. It recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan after he leaves home to become a musketeer. D'Artagnan is not one of the musketeers of the title; those are his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis -- inseparable friends who live by the motto, \"One for all, and all for one\".The Three Musketeers was first published in serial form in the magazine Le Siècle between March and July 1844. Dumas claimed it was based on manuscripts he had discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale. It was later proven that Dumas had based his work on the book Mémoires de Monsieur D'Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la première compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi (Memoirs of Mister D'Artagnan, Lieutenant Captain of the first company of the King's Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700). Dumas' version of the story covers the adventures of D'Artagnan and his friends from 1625 to 1628, as they are involved in intrigues involving the weak King Louis XIII of France, his powerful and cunning advisor Cardinal Richelieu, the beautiful Queen Anne of Austria, her English lover, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and the Siege of La Rochelle. Adding to the intrigue are the mysterious Milady de Winter, and Richelieu's right-hand man, the Comte de Rochefort.

Over the centuries, the novel has been repeatedly banned by authorities, assuring its preeminent role in the history of the ongoing struggle against censorship of free expression.Until Fanny Hill, previous heroines had conducted their amorous liaisons \"off-stage.\" Any erotic misadventures were described euphemistically. As women who had gone astray, they always repented, which made even their most outrageous dalliances somehow suitable for a moralistic readership. The protagonist of Fanny Hill, however, never repented a single moment of her sexual exploits ... quite the contrary! And with Fanny, the devil is in the details, realistically described.

A children's classic!Robin Hood is the archetypal English folk hero; a courteous, pious and swashbuckling outlaw of the mediæval era who, in modern versions of the legend, is famous for robbing the rich to feed the poor and fighting against injustice and tyranny. He operates with his \"seven score\" (140 strong) group of fellow outlawed yeomen – named the Merry Men. He and his band are usually associated with Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. The Victorian era generated its own distinct versions of Robin Hood. The traditional tales were often adapted for children, most notably in Howard Pyle's Merry Adventures of Robin Hood. These versions firmly stamp Robin as a staunch philanthropist, a man who takes from the rich to give to the poor.

When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferrars, a match that seems much more suitable. All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways. Since this is an Austen novel and a romance, be assured that all comes right in the end.(Summary by Michelle Crandall)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS

Psychology","author":"Sigmund Freud","description":"Librivox recording of Dream Psychology, by Sigmund Freud. Translated by M.D. Eder.    Not a few serious-minded students, […], have been discouraged from attempting a study of Freud’s dream psychology. The book in which he originally offered to the world his interpretation of dreams was as circumstantial as a legal record to be pondered over by scientists at their leisure, not to be assimilated in a few hours by the average alert reader. In those days, Freud could not leave out any detail likely to make his extremely novel thesis evidentially acceptable to those willing to sift data. - Freud himself, however, realized the magnitude of the task which the reading of his magnum opus imposed upon those who have not been prepared for it by long psychological and scientific training and he abstracted from that gigantic work the parts which constitute the essential of his discoveries.The publishers of the present book deserve credit for presenting to the reading public the gist of Freud’s psychology in the master’s own words, and in a form which shall neither discourage beginners, nor appear too elementary to those who are more advanced in psychoanalytic study. - Dream psychology is the key to Freud’s works and to all modern psychology. With a simple, compact manual such as Dream Psychology there shall be no longer any excuse for ignorance of the most revolutionary psychological system of modern times.(From the book introduction, by Andre Tridon)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.Read by Librivox volunteersFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B (163MB)\n","cover":"https://ia600207.us.archive.org/3/items/dream_psychology_librivox/dream_psychology_1101.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-05-18 16:11:18","Boxid":"OL100020416","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-17T00:49:42Z","Identifier":"dream_psychology_librivox","Runtime":"6:04:02","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"00 - Introduction","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_00_sigmundfreud.mp3"},{"title":"01 - Dreams Have a Meaning","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_01_sigmundfreud.mp3"},{"title":"02 - The Dream Mechanism","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_02_sigmundfreud.mp3"},{"title":"03 - Why the Dream Disguises the Desires","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_03_sigmundfreud.mp3"},{"title":"04 - Dream Analysis","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_04_sigmundfreud.mp3"},{"title":"05 - Sex in Dreams","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_05_sigmundfreud.mp3"},{"title":"06 - The Wish in Dreams","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_06_sigmundfreud.mp3"},{"title":"07 - The Function of the Dream","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_07_sigmundfreud.mp3"},{"title":"08 - The Primary and Secondary Process - Regression","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_08_sigmundfreud.mp3"},{"title":"09 - The Unconscious and Consiousness - Reality","source":"https://archive.org/download/dream_psychology_librivox/dreampsychology_09_sigmundfreud.mp3"}]},{"title":"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde","author":"Robert Louis Stevenson","description":"Librivox recording of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson.Read by David BarnesThe Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a novella by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, first published in 1886.  London lawyer Utterson is driven to investigate Edward Hyde, the unlikely protege of his friend Dr Henry Jekyll, suspecting the relationship to be founded on blackmail.  The truth is worse than he could have imagined.  Jekyll's 'full statement of the case', the final chapter of the book, explores the idea of dual personality that led him to his experiments, and his inexorable and finally fatal descent into evil.

G. Wells","description":"LibriVox recording of The Island of Dr. Moreau, by H.G. Wells.\n\nThe Island of Doctor Moreau is an 1896 science fiction novel written by H. G. Wells, addressing ideas of society and community, human nature and identity, religion, Darwinism, and eugenics.When the novel was written in the late 19th century, England's scientific community was engulfed by debates on animal vivisection.

These memos survive and continue to inspire others to this day. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs. He explicates the Stoic philosophy that the only way a man can be harmed by others is to allow his reaction to overpower him. He shows no particular religious faith in his writings, but seems to believe that some sort of logical, benevolent force organizes the universe in such a way that even “bad” occurrences happen for the good of the whole.

Aylmer and Louise Maude)","description":"Librivox public domain recording of War and Peace, Book 01, by Leo Tolstoy.War and Peace (Russian: Война и мир, Voyna i mir; in original orthography: Война и миръ, Voyna i mir\") is an epic novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published from 1865 to 1869 in Russki Vestnik, which tells the story of Russian society during the Napoleonic Era. It is usually described as one of Tolstoy's two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world's greatest novels. War and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy's time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense. (Summary by Wikipedia) Note: The novel is split up in 15 books. This is the recording of book one, which covers events in the year 1805.

Read by Kara Shallenberg.Hear Heidi if you've ever longed to see the Swiss mountain slopes. This story transports the listener from the fine air and freedom of the mountaintop to the confines of Frankfurt, back to the peaks again, bounding in flowered fields with goats at your heels and sky utterly surrounding you.We meet Heidi when she is 5, led up the mountain by her aunt who has raised the orphan but must leave now for a position in Frankfurt. In a mountain cottage overlooking the valley is Heidi's grandfather, and there with him the girl's sweet, free nature expands with the vista. The author's voice is straightforward, and so is our reader's, with the child's wonder, devotion, and sometimes humorous good intentions. When Heidi is taken from the mountains and nearly doesn't make it back again, the most humorous as well as most heart-wringing scenes occur. All she learns during her absence from the mountain she brings back as seeds that will grow to benefit everyone around her.

Porter.Read by Mary AndersonPollyanna tells the story of Pollyanna Whittier, a young girl who goes to live with her wealthy Aunt Polly after her father’s death. Pollyanna’s philosophy of life centers around what she calls “The Glad Game”: she always tries to find something to be glad about in every situation, and to always do without delay whatever she thinks is right. With this philosophy, and her own sunny personality, she brings so much gladness to her aunt’s dispirited New England town that she transforms it into a pleasant, healthy place to live. Eventually, however, even Pollyanna’s robust optimism is put to the test when she loses the use of her legs in an accident.

The book's full title is On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. It introduced the theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It was controversial because it contradicted religious beliefs which underlay the then current theories of biology. Darwin's book was the culmination of evidence he had accumulated on the voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s and added to through continuing investigations and experiments since his return.(Summary from Wikipedia)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (187MB)Download M4B Part 2 (160MB)\n","cover":"https://ia802700.us.archive.org/23/items/origin_species_librivox/On_the_Origin_of_Species_by_Means_of_Natural_Selection_1005.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-03-02 18:07:10","Boxid":"OL100020109","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-28T18:38:19Z","Identifier":"origin_species_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"24:22:37","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"01A: Variation Under Domestication - Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/origin_species_librivox/origin_of_species_01A_darwin.mp3"},{"title":"01B: Variation Under Domestication - Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/origin_species_librivox/origin_of_species_01B_darwin.mp3"},{"title":"02: Variation Under Nature","source":"https://archive.org/download/origin_species_librivox/origin_of_species_02_darwin.mp3"},{"title":"03: Struggle for Existence","source":"https://archive.org/download/origin_species_librivox/origin_of_species_03_darwin.mp3"},{"title":"04A: Natural Selection;

Translated by Gunther Olesch, Anke Dreher, Amy Coulter, Stefan Langer and Semyon ChaichenetsRead by Adrian Praetzellis Siddhartha is one of the great philosophical novels. Profoundly insightful, it is also a beautifully written story that begins as Siddhartha, son of an Indian Brahman, leaves his family and begins a lifelong journey towards Enlightenment. On the way he faces the entire range of human experience and emotion: he lives with ascetics, meets Gotama the Buddha, learns the art of love from Kamala the courtesan, and is transformed by the simple philosophy of the ferryman Vasudeva whose wisdom comes not from learned teachings but from observing the River. Herman Hesse (1877-1962) was a German-Swiss novelist, poet, and painter. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946.

A young woman, Hester Prynne, is led from the town prison with her infant daughter, Pearl, in her arms and the scarlet letter “A” on her breast. The scarlet letter “A” represents the act of adultery that she has committed; it is to be a symbol of her sin for all to see. She will not reveal her lover’s identity, however, and the scarlet letter, along with her public shaming, is her punishment for her sin and her secrecy.

The account of Mowgli's adventures is followed by several short stories, including the tales of the brave white seal, Kotick, and the tenacious mongoose, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.  Packed with adventure and Jungle Law wisdom, this book has pervaded popular culture as the basis of many film and stage adaptations, including the popular Disney movie, and through its adoption as a motivational book by the Cub Scouts.

Read by Mark Nelson. John Carter, an American Civil War veteran, goes prospecting in Arizona and, when set upon by Indians, is mysteriously transported to Mars, called \"Barsoom\" by its inhabitants. Carter finds that he has great strength on this planet, due to its lesser gravity. Carter soon falls in among the Tharks, a nomadic tribe of the planet's warlike, four-armed, green inhabitants. Thanks to his strength and combat abilities he rises in position in the tribe and earns the respect eventually the friendship of Tars Tarkas one of the Thark chiefs.The Tharks subsequently capture Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, a member of the humanoid red Martian race. The red Martians inhabit a loose network of city states and control the desert planet's canals, along which its agriculture is concentrated. Carter rescues her from the green men to return her to her people.

Tarzan of the Apes is Burroughs’ exciting, if improbable, story of an English lord, left by the death of his stranded parents in the hands of a motherly African ape who raises him as her own. Although he is aware that he is different from the apes of his tribe, who are neither white nor hairless, he nevertheless regards them as his “people.” When older, larger, stronger apes decide that he an undesirable to be killed or expelled from the tribe, it is fortunate that Tarzan has learned the use of primitive weapons.    Although small and weak by ape standards, Tarzan is a human of god-like strength and agility to men who discover him. By studying these people, he gradually decides he is not an ape at all, but human.    And when he meets Jane, a beautiful American girl marooned with her father and friends on the hostile coast of Africa, Tarzan conceives love for her. When they are unexpectedly rescued before Tarzan can find a way to reveal his feelings to Jane, he determines to become civilized and follow her into the world of people – to find her and wed her, though he must cross continents and oceans, and compete with two other suitors for her hand.    This story was the subject of a successful film in 1932, with Tarzan being played by Johnny Weissmuller, who acted in a further eleven Tarzan films. According to Weissmuller in an interview with Mike Douglas, his famous ape-call was audio stitched together from a soprano, an alto, and a hog-caller! Summary by Mark F.

Read by Laurie Anne Walden.A Study in Scarlet, a short novel published in 1887, was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes story.  At the beginning of the book, Dr. Watson meets the detective for the first time and we ride along with them to the scene of a murder.  The crime baffles the Scotland Yard detectives, but of course Holmes solves it easily.  In the second half of the story, the scene shifts to Utah as we learn the murderer's history.  The action returns to London in the last two chapters.  In his first adventure, Holmes demonstrates many of the traits for which he later became well known:  meticulous study of a crime scene, brilliant deductive reasoning, aptitude for chemistry and music, and the somewhat annoying habit of withholding crucial facts from Watson (and consequently the reader) until the conclusion of the case.

The poem is commonly dated to the 8th or 7th century BC, and many scholars believe it is the oldest extant work of literature in the Greek language, making it the first work of European literature. The existence of a single author for the poems is disputed as the poems themselves show evidence of a long oral tradition and hence, multiple authors. The poem concerns events during the tenth and final year in the siege of the city of Iliun, or Troy, by the Greeks.

Basil is impressed by Dorian’s beauty and becomes infatuated with him, believing his beauty is responsible for a new mode in his art. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil’s, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry’s world view. Espousing a new hedonism, Lord Henry suggests the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfillment of the senses. Realizing that one day his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses his desire to sell his soul to ensure the portrait Basil has painted would age rather than himself. Dorian’s wish is fulfilled, plunging him into debauched acts. The portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul, with each sin displayed as a disfigurement of his form, or through a sign of aging. This reading uses the 20-chapter 1891 version of Wilde’s novel.

T. A. Hoffmann","description":"LibriVox recording of Klein Zaches, genannt Zinnober by E. T. A. Hoffmann.  Read in German by Karlsson Der hässliche und dumme Wechselbalg Klein Zaches wird aus Mitleid von der Fee Rosabelverde mit einem Zauber belegt, so dass alle ihn für außergewöhnlich schön und begabt halten und die guten Leistungen anderer stets ihm zugeschrieben werden, die anderen jedoch für seine Frechheiten bestraft werden. Als er in die Universitätsstadt Kerepes kommt, nennt er sich stolz \"Zinnober\". Obwohl der dort regierende Fürst Paphnutius erst kürzlich per Dekret die Aufklärung eingeführt hat, erliegen alle dem Zauber und der Herr Zinnober macht eine schnelle Karriere bis hin zum Minister am fürstlichen Hofe. Einer der wenigen, die die Blendung durchschauen, ist der romantische Schwärmer und Dichter Balthasar, der sich gerade Hoffnungen macht, das Herz der schönen Candida zu gewinnen, nun aber zusehen muss, wie auch diese völlig dem falschen Zauber des Zinnober verfällt und diesen sogar küsst. Verzweifelt sucht Balthasar Hilfe bei dem versteckt lebenden Magier Prosper Alpanus. Doch es ist eine schwierige Aufgabe, den Feenzauber zu brechen...  Das humoristische Kunstmärchen \"Klein Zaches, genannt Zinnober\" ist nach Hoffmanns eigenem Bekunden \"die lose, lockere Ausführung einer scherzhaften Idee\". Es lag dem Autor fern, sich über missgebildete Menschen lustig zu machen (der einzige, der dies in der Geschichte tut, der Student Fabian, wird vom Magier Prosper Alpanus abgestraft). Die Bezeichnung des Zaches als \"Missgeburt\" soll vielmehr von vorn herein die charakterliche und fachliche Inkompetenz des späteren Ministers deutlich machen. \"Klein Zaches\" ist eine humorvolle, ironische und skurrile Geschichte und eine teilweise groteske Satire auf blinden Wissenschaftsglauben, höfisches Leben, Politiker und das Obrigkeitsdenken.

Frank Baum","description":"Librivox recording of Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, by L. Frank Baum.Read by Judy BieberDorothy and the Wizard in Oz was the fourth of 14 Oz books written by L. Frank Baum (1856-1919). Published in 1908, while Baum was resident in Coronado, California, it is considered one of the \"darker\" of the Oz tales. However, it also is enlivened by Baum's considerable wit, penchant for puns, and dry social commentary. In this title, Dorothy, her kitten Eureka, Jim, a cab horse, and Zeb, a ranch hand, descend into the earth through a rift opened by an earthquake. There they encounter the \"humbug\" wizard who once ruled Oz. In their journey back to the earth's surface, they meet a number of potentially dangerous magical peoples and creatures including the cold-blooded Mangaboos, invisible bears, the flying wooden Gargoyles, a den of dragonettes, and an eccentric inventor. With a little help from Ozma, the group end up in Oz where they are treated to feasts and celebrations. The animals end up humbled by a few of their experiences in Oz, where all animals can talk, and return home a little wiser.

(Translated by Luis Segalá y Estalella.) Read in Spanish by Victor Villarraza La Odisea (en griego: Ὀδύσσεια, Odýsseia) es un poema épico griego compuesto por 24 cantos, atribuido al poeta griego Homero. Se cree que fue compuesta en el siglo VIII a. C., en los asentamientos que Grecia tenía en la costa oeste del Asia Menor (actual Turquía asiática). Según otros autores, la Odisea se completa en el siglo VII a. C. a partir de poemas que sólo describían partes de la obra actual. Fue originalmente escrita en lo que se ha llamado dialecto homérico. Narra la vuelta a casa del héroe griego Odiseo (Ulises en latín) tras la Guerra de Troya. Además de haber estado diez años fuera luchando, Odiseo tarda otros diez años en regresar a la isla de Ítaca, donde poseía el título de rey, período durante el cual su hijo Telémaco y su esposa Penélope han de tolerar en su palacio a los pretendientes que buscan desposarla (pues ya creían muerto a Odiseo), al mismo tiempo que consumen los bienes de la familia.

Volume I was published in 1776, and went through six printings (a remarkable feat for its time). Volumes II and III were published in 1781; volumes IV, V, VI in 1788-89. The original volumes were published as quartos, a common publishing practice of the time.The books cover the period of the Roman Empire after Marcus Aurelius, from just before 180 to 1453 and beyond, concluding in 1590. They take as their material the behaviour and decisions that led to the decay and eventual fall of the Roman Empire in the East and West, offering an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell.Gibbon is sometimes called the first \"modern historian of ancient Rome.\" By virtue of its mostly objective approach and highly accurate use of reference material, Gibbon's work was adopted as a model for the methodologies of 19th and 20th century historians.

John Ormsby).Don Quixote is an early novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. Cervantes created a fictional origin for the story in the character of the Morisco historian, Cide Hamete Benengeli, whom he claims to have hired to translate the story from an Arabic manuscript he found in Toledo’s bedraggled old Jewish quarter.The protagonist, Alonso Quixano, is a minor landowner who has read so many stories of chivalry that he descends into fantasy and becomes convinced he is a knight errant. Together with his companion Sancho Panza, the self-styled Don Quixote de la Mancha sets out in search of adventures. His “lady” is Dulcinea del Toboso, an imaginary object of his courtly love crafted from a neighbouring farmgirl by the illusion-struck “knight” (her real name is Aldonza Lorenzo, and she is totally unaware of his feelings for her. In addition, she never actually appears in the novel).Published in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age and perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.(Summary from Wikipedia)Read by Librivox volunteersFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (148MB)Download M4B Part 2 (143MB)Download M4B Part 3 (148MB)Download M4B Part 4 (150MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800706.us.archive.org/24/items/don_quixote_vol1_librivox/Don_Quixote_1_1003.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-04-24 15:17:48","Boxid":"OL100020314","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-27T16:01:32Z","Identifier":"don_quixote_vol1_librivox","Runtime":"21:16:36","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"01a -

Translated by Robert Southey. Read by volunteer readers.\n\nAmadis of Gaul (Amadís de Gaula, in Spanish) was not the first, but certainly one of the best known knight-errantry tales of the 16th century. Not only is its authorship doubtful, but even the language in which it was first written - Portuguese or Spanish. It is imagined to have been composed in the 14th century, but the known first printed edition came to light in Zaragoza in 1508, and the oldest extant version is in Spanish.The plot is the story of the brave knight Amadis, and starts with the forbidden love of his parents and his secret birth, followed by his abandonment near water. He is found and raised as the son of a knight. Upon reaching adulthood, he goes in a quest for his own identity, and investigates his origins through fantastic adventures: plenty of wizards, princesses, damsels in distress and other knights people the world of Amadis.Amadis of Gaul, together with Palmerin of England and Tirante the White, are the only books saved from the fire by Quixote's curate, when purging the knight's library: Tirante, for its quaintness; Palmerin, because he thought it had been written by the king himself; and Amadis, for being the best of its kind. Even if Cervante's praise works more as censure, it's a fact that Amadis represents the style as no other, and was the father of a numerous flock, becoming a landmark work among the knight-errantry tales and marking the story of European literature.

E. Marshall.  Read by Kara Shallenberg.  This is the first half of the book.  Part 2 may be found here: http://librivox.org/our-island-story-part-2-by-he-marshall/.Our Island Story was first published in 1905 and became an instant classic. Beginning with the Romans and following the triumphs and foibles of the good, not so good and the downright despicable figures of history; we are treated to a dazzling montage of kings, queens, barons, knights, explorers, movers and shakers that have played a key role in the history of England. Marshall freely mixes folk tale with historical fact and in so doing paints a very vivid picture of the past in a style reminiscent of all that is finest in the children's story telling tradition.This is the first section of that work and will carry you from the time when Tacitus first sang the praises of Britannica to his Roman readers up to the vicious and bloodthirsty confusion that is the War of the Roses (about 1500 years).

Read by Zachary Brewster-Geisz.In a surreal turn-of-the-century London, Gabriel Syme, a poet, is recruited to a secret anti-anarchist taskforce at Scotland Yard. Lucian Gregory, an anarchist poet, is the only poet in Saffron Park, until he loses his temper in an argument over the purpose of poetry with Gabriel Syme, who takes the opposite view. After some time, the frustrated Gregory finds Syme and leads him to a local anarchist meeting-place to prove that he is a true anarchist. Instead of the anarchist Gregory getting elected, the officer Syme uses his wits and is elected as the local representative to the worldwide Central Council of Anarchists. The Council consisting of seven men, each using the name of a day of the week as a code name; Syme is given the name of Thursday...

Read by Mark F. Smith. David Balfour, a lad of seventeen and newly orphaned, is directed to go and live with his rich uncle, the master of the estate of Shaws in the lowlands of Scotland near Edinburgh. His uncle, Ebenezer (as close a miser as Dickens' Ebenezer Scrooge), is shocked to suddenly have his young relative descend on him and tries to rid himself of David with an arranged accident. Failing that, he pays the captain of a brig to kidnap David and sell him into slavery in Carolina.A collision in the fog brings onboard the brig a survivor, Alan Breck Stewart, who is carrying a dangerous amount of gold on his person. David warns him of a plan by the brig's captain and crew to overpower him and seize the money, and then finds himself fighting alongside Alan in a battle royale. By good fortune, Alan is handy with a sword and they have access to the firearms locker, and the pair so completely defeat the crew that barely enough hands remain to sail her. Limping to port, she is holed by rocks, and David finds himself a castaway.Being in Alan's presence continues to be a chancy business. David is talking to Colin Roy Campbell, the King's Factor who has been oppressing Alan's people, when the man is shot to death, and David is chased as an accomplice. The two \"take to the heather\" and barely survive near brushes with redcoats as they thread through the Trossachs and other highland ranges of Scotland. Only after an arduous weeks-long trek through territory where they are actively hunted do they emerge in the more settled districts around the river Forth, only to find guards upon the bridge. With no money remaining, they must somehow cross to Queensferry, find Ebenezer's lawyer, and lay claim to David's inheritance in order to send Alan safely on to France. (summary by Mark F.

The tales, some of which are originals and others not, are contained inside a frame tale and told by a group of pilgrims on their way from Southwark to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral.The themes of the tales vary, and include topics such as courtly love, treachery, and avarice.

Read by Brenda Dayne.In an era before the advent of electric lights, telephones or motor vehicles, there exists a small cluster of aristocratic “old revolutionary stock” families that rule New York’s social life. Under the rules of this society, “being things” is better than “doing things” and reputation and outward appearances come at the exclusion of everything else. In this Gilded Age, when America’s expansion and increased industrialism produce a group of newly wealthy robber barons and financiers, the patient, time-honored values of the old ruling class, and century, are giving way to the expediencies of the new. Caught at this cusp, a triangle of lovers, who must choose between the expectations of family and society, and the deepest yearnings of the heart.Newly engaged couple, Newland Archer, a young lawyer, and May Welland, a society debutante, are part of the old world, where the “right people” follow the “correct rules” and marry into “acceptable families.” The arrival from Europe of May’s cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska, complicates their union, as Ellen’s mysterious past threatens to cast a shadow of scandal over the newly betrothed couple. Newland Archer, at first critical of Ellen’s bohemian lifestyle, and her seemingly wilful ignorance of the rules and customs of his Old New York, is soon captivated by Ellen’s warmth, spirit, and her generous and loving heart. Will he cast off the life for which he’s been groomed, or sacrifice happiness for duty and the greater good of the social order?(Summary by Brenda Dayne)For further information, including links to

Read by Elizabeth Klett. Jane Austen famously described Emma Woodhouse, the title character of her 1815 novel, as \"a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\" Yet generations of readers have loved Emma, as much for her blunders as for her wit and vivacity. Emma, \"handsome, clever, and rich,\" has nothing else to do but try to pair off her friends, and she consistently mis-reads the relationships and situations around her as much as she mis-reads her own heart. The novel features a wonderful cast of characters, including Emma's hypochondriac father, the odiously prideful Mrs. Elton, the mysterious and reserved Jane Fairfax, and Miss Bates, who never stops talking.

Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the narrative follows Leopold Bloom and a number of other characters through an ordinary day, twenty four hours, in Dublin, on June 16, 1904. The text is dense and difficult, but perfectly suited to an oral reading, filled with language tricks, puns and jokes, stream of consciousness, and bawdiness.\n\nNOTE:\nBecause of the nature of this project, there was a bending of usual LibriVox procedures: pub-like background noise was encouraged, as well as creative group readings; and no editing was required, so in places there is some accidental variation from the original text ... Listener be warned!. Here is some more information about the genesis of the LibriVox Ulysses project.(Summary by Hugh McGuire)\n\nListeners who would prefer a more conventional recording are invited to download version 2 instead.\n\nRead by Librivox volunteers\n\nFor further information, including links to M4B audio book, online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go

Translated by Carol Della Chiesa.\n\nRead by Mark F. Smith. \n\nDo today's children still learn what a \"marionette\" is? The beloved story of Pinocchio may represent a last lingering picture of a world not dominated by plastic or electronic toys.\n\nPinocchio is a puppet made from a piece of wood that curiously could talk even before being carved. A wooden-head he starts and a wooden-head he stays - until after years of misadventures caused by his laziness and failure to keep promises he finally learns to care about his family - and then he becomes a real boy.\n\nFor those who have seen the Disney movie the cast of characters will be familiar, from the Talking Cricket (who acts as his conscience) to Lamp-Wick, his partner in truancy and having heedless fun.\n\nThough the toys of today are far from the puppet shows in Carlo Collodi's book, his themes of being truthful, thoughtful, and dependable will always be timely.\n\n(Summary by

The book portrays a parricide in which each of a murdered man's sons share a varying degree of complicity. The Brothers Karamazov is a passionate philosophical novel that explores deep into the ethical debates of God, free will, and morality. It is a spiritual drama of moral struggles concerning faith, doubt, reason, and modern Russia. Since its publication, it has been acclaimed all over the world by thinkers as diverse as Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, and Pope Benedict XVI as one of the supreme achievements in literature.

The twenty pieces which comprise this book, unrelated as some of them are in the letter, will be found to be harmonious in the spirit, in that they point the reader towards those heights of self-knowledge and self-conquest which, rising above the turbulence of the world, lift their peaks where the Heavenly Silence reigns.(Summary from Above Life's Turmoil)Read by Andrea Fiore.For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B (34MB)\n","cover":"https://ia902604.us.archive.org/32/items/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/above_lifes_turmoil_1012.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2009-01-06 22:45:39","Boxid":"OL100020219","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-06T04:44:52Z","Identifier":"lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox","Runtime":"2:24:16","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2009          ","audios":[{"title":"0 - Foreword, True Happiness, The Immortal Man","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_0_jamesallen.mp3"},{"title":"1 - The Overcoming of Self, The Uses of Temptation","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_1_jamesallen.mp3"},{"title":"2 - The Man of Integrity, Discrimination","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_2_jamesallen.mp3"},{"title":"3 - Belief, the Basis of Action; Belief that Saves","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_3_jamesallen.mp3"},{"title":"4 - Thought and Action, Your Mental Attitude","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_4_jamesallen.mp3"},{"title":"5 - Sowing and Reaping, The Reign of Law","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_5_jamesallen.mp3"},{"title":"6 - The Supreme Justice, The Use of Reason","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_6_jamesallen.mp3"},{"title":"7 - Self-Discipline, Resolution","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_7_jamesallen.mp3"},{"title":"8 - The Glorious Conquest, Contentment in Activity","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_8_jamesallen.mp3"},{"title":"9 - The Temple of Brotherhood, Pleasant Pastures of Peace","source":"https://archive.org/download/lifes_turmoil_af_0901_librivox/lifesturmoil_9_jamesallen.mp3"}]},{"title":"Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland","author":"Lewis Carroll","description":"LibriVox Aufnahme von Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland, von Lewis Carroll.

He found himself captivated by the warm thrust of her breasts beneath the silk blouse. The clear milk of her flesh, at the “V” of her throat excited him in a strange way. When he thought of her as his wife, it was frightening. It was as though someone had tossed him a woman and expected him to just fall into the routine of marriage. It wouldn’t be hard to come to love this woman, but it would take awhile. Hell, he didn’t know her. She was a complete stranger who had suddenly told him they were married. There was nothing familiar about her; even the fingers that were softly working over his face were alien. (Summary by Blurb from the Front Flap!)

Read in English by David Clarke The book was first published in February 1905 by McClure, Phillips & Co. (New York) then on March 7, 1905 by Georges Newnes, Ltd. (London) and was the first Holmes collection since 1893, when Holmes had \"died\" in The Final Problem. Having published The Hound of the Baskervilles in 1901–1902 (setting it before Holmes' death) Doyle came under intense pressure to revive his famous character. The first story is set in 1894 and has Holmes returning in London and explaining the period from 1891–94, a period called \"The Great Hiatus\" by Sherlockian enthusiasts. Also of note is Watson's statement in the last story of the cycle that Holmes has retired, and forbids him to publish any more stories. - Summary by Wikipedia For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

Rider Haggard","description":"Allan Quatermain was the quintessential Victorian English gentleman cum African big-game hunter. In this book, the second in the series, Quaterman and his two good friends from KSM have tired of their dull and unfulfilling lives in England, and decide to search for the truth of an old tale about the existence of an isolated white kingdom deep in darkest Africa. Their journey and subsequent adventures are sure to satisfy those who enjoy tales of dangerous quests and heroic just-in-time derring-do.  Allan Quatermain appears in some 15 to 18 stories or books by H. Rider Haggard. (The number varies by source and apparently depends on how one chooses to count the shorter stories.) Haggard suggests that Quatermain was the author of the works, and he (Haggard) only edited and published them. The most famous Quatermain book is the first, King Solomon’s Mines (1885), and the sequel (1887) was Allan Quatermain - in which the main character, shall we say, departs for a better place! All the other Quatermain books – even those whose events occurred earlier in time – seem to have been written after these two main titles.  The internal chronology of Quatermain’s life is a big mess, to be honest. As you study the research and learn of the numerous contradictions of timing of events in the books, you see that conjecture and invention are required to create any kind of internal chronology that makes sense. So my advice is to read (listen to) the books for enjoyment, don’t take notes!, and don’t worry about how one event simply can’t be possible on the apparent date because it conflicts wtih some other event in a different story! Hey! It’s fiction – anything goes!Summary and recording by John NicholsonFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.Download M4B Part 1 (188MB)Download M4B Part 2 (176MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800909.us.archive.org/13/items/allan_quatermain_librivox/Allan_Quatermain_1107.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-01-30 21:01:51","Boxid":"OL100020214","Identifier":"allan_quatermain_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"300","Runtime":"13:07:04","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"00 - Introduction","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_00_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"01 - The Consul's Yarn","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_01_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"02 - The Black Hand","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_02_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"03 - The Mission Station","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_03_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"04 - Alphonse and His Annette","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_04_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"05 - Umslopogaas Makes a Promise","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_05_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"06 - The Night Wears On","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_06_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"07 - A Slaughter Grim and Great","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_07_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"08 - Alphonse Explains","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_08_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"09 - Into the Unknown","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_09_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"10 - The Rose of Fire","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_10_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"11 - The Frowning City","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_11_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"12 - The Sister Queens","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_12_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"13 - About the Zu-Vendi People","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_13_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"14 - The Flower Temple","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_14_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"15 - Sorais' Song","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_15_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"16 - Before the Statue","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_16_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"17 - The Storm Breaks","source":"https://archive.org/download/allan_quatermain_librivox/quatermain_17_haggard.mp3"},{"title":"18 - War!

Read by Cori Samuel.Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is a novel written by the British author Mary Shelley. Shelley wrote the novel when she was 18 years old. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818, and this audiobook is read from that text. Shelley's name appeared on the revised third edition, published in 1831. The title of the novel refers to the scientist, Victor Frankenstein, who learns how to create life and creates a being in the likeness of man, but larger than average and more powerful. In modern popular culture, people have tended to refer to the Creature as \"Frankenstein\" (especially in films since 1931), despite this being the name of the scientist, and the creature being unnamed in the book itself. Frankenstein is a novel infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. It was also a warning against the \"over-reaching\" of modern man and the Industrial Revolution, alluded to in the novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus. The story has had an influence across literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories and films.

Read in English by Mark Nelson The novel recounts the life of a young man, Lucian Taylor, focusing on his dreamy childhood in rural Wales, in a town based on Caerleon. The Hill of Dreams of the title is an old Roman fort where Lucian has strange sensual visions, including ones of the town in the time of Roman Britain. Later it describes Lucian's attempts to make a living as an author in London, enduring poverty and suffering in the pursuit of art. Generally thought to be Machen's greatest work, it was little noticed on its publication in 1907 save in a glowing review by Alfred Douglas. It was actually written between 1895 and 1897 and has elements of the style of the decadent and aesthetic movement of the period, seen through Machen's own mystical preoccupations. - Summary by Wikipedia For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

Lawson)This is an introduction to Einstein's space-bending, time-stretching theory of Relativity, written by the master himself. Special and General relativity explain the structure of space time and provide a theory of gravitation, respectively. Einstein's theories shocked the world with their counterintuitive results, including the dissolution of absolute time. In this book he brings a simplified form of his profound understanding of the subject to the layperson. In the words of Einstein: \"The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.\" The book is challenging at times but, when approached patiently, proves itself one of the most lucid explanations of Relativity to be found anywhere. [Due to transcription or optical character recognition errors  in creating online texts, and because of less-than-clear fonts in some printed texts, the variables as read in some of the equations here are not as Einstein intended. For example, the numeral 'one' has frequently been printed and read as the letter 'I.' In addition, some equations do not translate well into the spoken word. If you require completely accurate renditions of Einstein's mathematical formulas, we suggest that you consult a published text.] (Summary written by Kelly Bescherer [and Laurie Anne Walden])For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.M4B audiobook of Complete Book\n","cover":"https://ia800701.us.archive.org/9/items/relativity_librivox/relativity_1003.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-03-27 14:21:04","Boxid":"OL100020009","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-12T16:38:00Z","Identifier":"relativity_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"3:39.23","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"00 Preface - Relativity","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_00_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"01 - Sections 01-03 - Relativity Pt. 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_01-03_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"02 - Sections 04-06 - Relativity Pt. 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_04-06_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"03 - Sections 07-09 - Relativity Pt. 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_07-09_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"04 - Sections 10-12 - Relativity Pt. 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_10-12_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"05 - Sections 13-15 - Relativity Pt. 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_13-15_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"06 - Sections 16-17 - Relativity Pt. 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_16-17_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"07 - Sections 18-20 - Relativity Pt. 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_18-20_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"08 - Sections 21-23 - Relativity Pt. 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_21-23_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"09 - Sections 24-26 - Relativity Pt. 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_24-26_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"10 - Sections 27-29 - Relativity Pt. 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_27-29_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"11 - Sections 30-31 - Relativity Pt. 3","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_30-32_einstein.mp3"},{"title":"12 - Appendix III - Relativity","source":"https://archive.org/download/relativity_librivox/relativity_33_einstein.mp3"}]},{"title":"The Story of the Three Little Pigs","author":"L.

The prose is beautiful and occasionally requires the use of a dictionary - I had to look up “asperities.” Written as a children’s story, The Wind in the Willows is enjoyed by many grown-ups who relish Grahame’s ability to evoke the long summer days of childhood.

What's going on here?  It's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Shakespeare at his most fanciful.  The play opens with Theseus, Duke of Athens, preparing for his wedding.  Egeus complains to Theseus that his daughter Hermia refuses to marry Demetrius.  When Hermia is given the choice between marriage to Demetrius or life as a nun, she and her true love Lysander flee into the forest.  Demetrius follows them; and Helena, who loves Demetrius, follows him.  Also in the forest are Oberon and Titania, king and queen of the fairies, at odds with one another.  At Oberon's behest, Puck causes Demetrius to fall in love with Helena -- oops, he missed, that was Lysander instead.  Mayhem ensues.  In the meantime, a group of bumbling craftsmen rehearses a play.  Puck gives one of them, Bottom, the head of an ass and makes Titania fall in love with him.  Further hilarity results as Bottom sees nothing at all odd about this.  Eventually everything is straightened out, Bottom and the rest \"perform\" their play, there is a triple wedding, and Puck assures us the whole thing has been a dream.  Number of quotes you know: 5 (what fools these mortals be).  Useful insults: 19.  (Summary by Laurie Anne Walden)Cast:Theseus, Duke of Athens – Mark F.

Read by John Greenman.Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (often shortened to Huck Finn) is a novel written by Mark Twain and published in 1884. It is commonly regarded as one of the Great American Novels, and is one of the first major American novels written in the vernacular, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry \"Huck\" Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels.The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. By satirizing a Southern antebellum society that was already anachronistic at the time, the book is an often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and freedom in all of American literature.The book has been popular with young readers since its publication and is taken as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. It has also been the continued object of study by serious literary critics. The book was criticized upon release because of its coarse language, and became even more controversial in the 20th century because of its perceived use of racial stereotypes and because of its frequent use of the racial slur, \"nigger.\" In answer to a critic of his style, Twain once said, \"A discriminating irreverence is the creator and protector of human liberty.\" (Summary by Wikipedia

The book, set in 1547, tells the story of two young boys who are identical in appearance: Tom Canty, a pauper who lives with his abusive father in Offal Court, London, and Prince Edward son of Henry VIII of England.  Due to a series of circumstances, the boys accidentally replace each other, and much of the humor in the book originates in the two boys' inability to function in the world that is so familiar to the other (although Tom soon displays considerable wisdom in his decisions). In many ways, the book is a social satire, particularly compelling in its condemnation of the inequality that existed between the classes in Tudor England. In that sense, Twain abandoned the wry Midwestern style for which he was best known and adopts a style reminiscent of Charles Dickens.

Read by Mark F Smith.The Kama Sutra, or Aphorisms on Love, has survived at least 1400 years as a dominant text on sexual relations between men and women. Vatsyayana claimed to have written the Kama Sutra while a religious student, “in contemplation of the Deity” - but references to older works, shrewd disputations by Vatsyayana of those authors' recommendations, and careful cataloging of practices in various of the Indian states indicate much more emphasis on kama, or sensual gratification. Part of the book discusses the 64 arts of love employed by masters of coitus. Learning each of these and when and how to practice them, Vatsyayana affirms, not only leads to the best gratification, but makes the artist a person of great desirability. Once the means of sexual congress are discussed, the many types of male-female relationships and their proper prosecution are covered. Some of these have small relevance to the modern world, such as how to sneak into the King's harem, but are interesting nonetheless. Others, such as how to get money from a lover, will probably remain useful as long as there are humans in the world. The translator's concluding remarks call the book primitive; so might also modern women who are told that if their name ends in “l” or “r” they should not be married, because they are worthless. But in tackling the subject of human sexuality, Vatsyayana nevertheless will always attract readers (or, in this case, listeners!).(Summary by Mark F Smith)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit LibriVox.org.Download M4B (179MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800304.us.archive.org/19/items/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/KamaSutra_1208.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2010-08-26 15:44:40","Boxid":"OL100020311","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-06T05:28:34Z","Identifier":"kama_sutra_1008_librivox","Runtime":"6:15:58","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2010          ","audios":[{"title":"01 - Introduction and Part 1, Chapter 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_01_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"02 - Part 1, Chapter 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_02_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"03 - Part 1, Chaps 3 & 4","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_03_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"04 - Part 1, Chapter 5","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_04_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"05 - Part 2, Chapters 1 & 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_05_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"06 - Part 2, Chapters 3 & 4","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_06_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"07 - Part 2, Chapters 5 & 6","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_07_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"08 - Part 2, Chapters 7 & 8","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_08_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"09 - Part 2, Chapters 9 & 10","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_09_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"10 - Part 3, Chapters 1 & 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_10_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"11 - Part 3, Chapters 3, 4, & 5","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_11_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"12 - Part 4, Chapters 1 & 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_12_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"13 - Part 5, Chapters 1 & 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_13_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"14 - Part 5, Chapters 3 & 4","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_14_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"15 - Part 5, Chapters 5 & 6","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_15_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"16 - Part 6, Intro, Chap 1 & 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_16_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"17 - Part 6, Chapters 3 & 4","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_17_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"18 - Part 6, Chapters 5 & 6","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_18_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"19 - Part 7, Chapter 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_19_vatsyayana.mp3"},{"title":"20 - Part 7, Chapter 2 & Concluding Remarks","source":"https://archive.org/download/kama_sutra_1008_librivox/kamasutra_20_vatsyayana.mp3"}]},{"title":"Chapters from my Autobiography","author":"Mark Twain","description":"Librivox recording of Chapters from my Autobiography by Mark Twain.Read by John Greenman.Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) began writing his autobiography long before the 1906 publications of these Chapters from my Autobiography.

James, in the public domain. \n\nThe LibriVox catalog page for this work lists the LibriVox readers.\n\nConsolation of Philosophy (Latin: Consolatio Philosophiae) is a philosophical work by Boethius written in about the year 524 AD. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West in medieval and early Renaissance Christianity, and is also the last great work that can be called Classical. \n\nConsolation of Philosophy was written during Boethius' one year imprisonment while awaiting trial, and eventual horrific execution, for the crime of treason by Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great. Boethius was at the very heights of power in Rome and was brought down by treachery. It was from this experience he was inspired to write a philosophical book from prison reflecting on how a lord's favor could change so quickly and why friends would turn against him. It has been described as 'by far the most interesting example of prison literature the world has ever seen.' \n\nThe Consolation of Philosophy stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the heathen philosophy of Seneca the Younger and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by Thomas Aquinas. - The book is heavily influenced by Plato and his dialogues (as was Boethius himself).

As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian-Regency England; she also creates a lively comedy of manners among her characters.\n\nBefore she began the novel, Austen wrote, \"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\" In the very first sentence she introduces the title character as \"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich.\" Emma, however, is also rather spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives, and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.

Cornelius Van Baerle has joined the race to breed a truly black tulip – and to win the prize of 100,000 guilders, as well as fame and honour.

(Translated by Vincente Guimerá.) Read in Spanish by Victor Villarraza. El flemático y solitario caballero británico Phileas Fogg abandonará su vida de escrupulosa disciplina para cumplir con una apuesta con sus colegas del Club Reformista (Reform Club), en la que arriesgará la mitad de su fortuna comprometiéndose a dar la vuelta al mundo en sólo ochenta días usando los medios disponibles en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX y siguiendo el proyecto publicado en el Morning Chronicle, su periódico de lectura cotidiana. Lo acompañará su recién contratado mayordomo francés, y tendrá que lidiar no sólo con los retrasos en los medios de transporte, sino con la pertinaz persecución del detective Fix, que, ignorando la verdadera identidad del caballero, se enrola en toda la aventura a la espera de una orden de arresto de la Corona británica, en la creencia de que, antes de partir, Fogg robó el Banco de Inglaterra.

Without pride or prejudice, Fanny sticks to principles in all matters. And matters certainly put her to the test.

Recording by Cori Samuel.Black Beauty is a fictional autobiographical memoir told by a horse, who recounts many tales, both of cruelty and kindness. The title page of the first edition states that it was \"Translated from the Original Equine by Anna Sewell.\" It was composed in the last years of her life, during which she was confined to her house as an invalid. After its publication in 1877, Sewell lived just long enough to see her first and only novel become an immediate bestseller, as well as it encouraging the better treatment of many cruelly-treated animals.Although initially intended for people who work with horses, it soon became a children's classic. While outwardly teaching animal welfare, it also contains allegorical lessons about how to treat people with kindness, sympathy and respect. The story is narrated in the first person and each short chapter relates an incident in Black Beauty's life, with Sewell's detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal of verisimilitude.Summary adapted from Wikipedia by Cori Samuel, with help.For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

Frank Baum","description":"Librivox recording of 'The Emerald City of Oz', by L. Frank Baum.Read by Judy BieberThe Emerald City of Oz (1910) was the sixth Oz book written by L. Frank Baum, a title he hoped would be the last. In this book, Dorothy and her impoverished Uncle Henry and Aunt Em are on the brink of losing their Kansas farm. Consequently, Ozma invites them all to live in the Emerald City. They then explore the countryside, visiting a series of strange beings including the Cuttenclips, the Fuddles, the Rigmaroles, the Flutterbudgets, and the residents of Utensia, Bunbury and Bunnybury. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry also meet old friends like the Wizard, the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead and H. M. Wogglebug T. E. The travelers' idyll is brought short by the plot of an old enemy, the Nome King. Seeking revenge for the loss of his magic belt, the Nome King has an underground tunnel built so he can invade and plunder Oz and enslave its peoples. Our friends manage to defeat the Nome King and his allies, but sobered by this threat, Glinda and Ozma decide to cut off Oz from the outside world forever. Happily for Oz fans, forever lasted only three years. Baum invented a way to reopen communications with Oz and eight more Oz books were published between 1913-1920.

Read by Christopher Smith.Towards the close of his ministry on earth, Jesus taught his disciples of the need for them to abide in Him. This word \"abide\" speaks of the intimacy of fellowship with the Master to which his followers are still invited. Andrew Murray wrote this series of meditations, which he subtitled \"Thoughts on the Blessed Life of Fellowship with the Son of God\", out of a conviction that many believers are missing out on something that is really at the heart of a healthy Christian life. The author explains that many, although they trust the Lord for forgiveness and help, have yet to experience the blessing of a day by day and hour by hour walk with the Lord, and therefore are not enjoying the power, the joy and the fruitfulness that is available to each one. He shows how, by taking the time to live closer to Jesus, we may move into a deeper and stronger Christian experience.

The Wolf-Leader by Alexandre Dumas. (Translated by Alfred Allinson.) Read in English by John Van StanPart local legend of a dark and dangerous Wolf-Leader, part childhood memories of his home near Villers-Cotterets, in Aisne, Dumas here penned a chilling supernaturlal encounter between man and the devil. Our hero, Thibault the shoemaker, is beaten on the orders of the Lord of Vez for hunting in the lord's forest. With Thibault's resentment at his treatment by the world at its height, the devil sees his chance and, in the guise of a wolf, proposes a deal which Thibault accepts; the ever available trade of one's soul for evil power.

Seventy-seven of the essays were published serially in The Independent Journal and The New York Packet between October 1787 and August 1788 . A compilation of these and eight others, called The Federalist, was published in 1788 by J. and A. M’Lean.The Federalist Papers serve as a primary source for interpretation of the Constitution, as they outline the philosophy and motivation of the proposed system of government.The authors of the Federalist Papers wanted to both influence the vote in favor of ratification and shape future interpretations of the Constitution. According to historian Richard Morris, they are an “incomparable exposition of the Constitution, a classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later American writer.”(Summary by Wikipedia)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox

Some of these nursery rhymes are complete tales in themselves.  There are others which are mere suggestions, leaving the imagination to weave in the details of the story. Many of the rhymes’ origins even at the time of this book’s writing could be traced back decades or centuries. L. Frank Baum in 1897, while living in Chicago, collected the rhymes and created short stories around them which add context and understanding for children who are drawn to the familiar melodies.

John Milton saw himself as the intellectual heir of Homer, Virgil, and Dante, and sought to create a work of art which fully represented the most basic tenets of the Protestant faith. His work, which was dictated from memory and transcribed by his daughter, remains as one of the most powerful English poems. (Summary by Caeristhiona)This is a recording of the text of Milton's first edition of 1667, which had ten books, unlike the second edition (1674) which was redivided into twelve books in the manner of Virgil's Aeneid.

The chief characters - Mole, Rat, and Toad - generally lead upbeat and happy lives, but their tales are leavened with moments of terror, homesickness, awe, madcap antics, and derring-do.  \n\nAlthough classed as children's literature, The Wind in the Willows holds a gentle fascination for adults too. The vocabulary is decidedly not \"Dick and Jane\", and a reader with a love of words will find new ones to treasure, even if well-equipped for the journey. Parents will appreciate the themes of loyalty, manners, self-restraint, and comradeship which are evident throughout the book. When the characters err, they are prompt to acknowlege it, and so a reading of this book can model good behavior to children, who will otherwise be enchanted with the many ways in which the lives of these bucolic characters differ from modern life.  \n\nThis book was so successful that it enabled the author to retire from banking and take up a country life somewhat like that of his creations. It has been adapted for screen, stage, and even a ride at the original Disneyland.   (Summary by Mark F.

Drawing on Danish chronicles and the Elizabethan vogue for revenge tragedy, Shakespeare created a play that is at once a philosophic treatise, a family drama, and a supernatural thriller. In the wake of his father's death, Prince Hamlet finds that his Uncle Claudius has swiftly taken the throne and married his mother, Queen Gertrude.

The novel classically evokes the sea-faring life at the turn of the century. While Macwhirr is emotionally estranged from his family and crew, and though he refuses to consider an alternate course to skirt the typhoon, his indomitable will in the face of a superior natural force elicits grudging admiration.(Summary from Wikipedia)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.M4B format available\n","cover":"https://ia800306.us.archive.org/16/items/typhoon_conrad_librivox/Typhoon_1108.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-05-18 20:19:31","Boxid":"OL100020302","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-01T22:56:32Z","Identifier":"typhoon_conrad_librivox","Runtime":"2:38:46","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"Chapter 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/typhoon_conrad_librivox/typhoon_1_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/typhoon_conrad_librivox/typhoon_2_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 3","source":"https://archive.org/download/typhoon_conrad_librivox/typhoon_3_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 4","source":"https://archive.org/download/typhoon_conrad_librivox/typhoon_4_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 5","source":"https://archive.org/download/typhoon_conrad_librivox/typhoon_5_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 6","source":"https://archive.org/download/typhoon_conrad_librivox/typhoon_6_conrad.mp3"}]},{"title":"The American Claimant","author":"Mark Twain","description":"LibriVox recording of The American Claimant, by Mark Twain.

Twain wrote the novel with the help of phonographic dictation, the first author (according to Twain himself) to do so. This was also (according to Twain) an attempt to write a book without mention of the weather, the first of its kind in fictitious literature. Indeed, all the weather is contained in an appendix, at the back of the book, which the reader is encouraged to turn to from time to time.

Read in Spanish by Mongope Cañas y barro relata la historia de una de las familias más importantes de La Abufera valenciana. Generación tras generación se han ganado el prestigio pescando y siendo los mejores barqueros del Palmar. Sin embargo, Tono, hijo del tío Paloma, decide abandonar la pesca y dedicarse a labrar los campos, lo que a consecuencia del fuerte carácter del tío Paloma, se traduce en una gran enemistad entre padre e hijo. Por otro lado, Tonet hijo de Tono y nieto del tío Paloma, es un muchacho débil de carácter al que le gusta la vida fácil; esto unido a la relación amorosa con Neleta, su amor de la infancia, pero ya casada con Cañamel, conducirá a la familia al total desprestigio.

Read by LivelyHive.\n\nThe Autobiography of Charles Darwin is the autobiography of the British naturalist Charles Darwin which was published in 1887, five years after his death.\n\nDarwin wrote the book, which he entitled Recollections of the Development of my Mind and Character, for his family. He states that he started writing it on about May 28, 1876 and had finished it by August 3.\n\nThe book was edited by Charles Darwin's son Francis Darwin, who removed several passages about Darwin's critical views of God and Christianity. It was published in London by John Murray as part of The life and letters of Charles Darwin, including an autobiographical chapter.\n\nThe omitted passages were later restored by Darwin's granddaughter Nora Barlow in a 1958 edition to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the publication of The Origin. This edition was published in London by Collins under the title of The Autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809-1882, with the original omissions restored, edited and with appendix and notes by his granddaughter Nora Barlow.The original is in the public domain as its copyright has expired, but the later version remains under copyright.

She encouraged them to dress and act like boys at home, yet dress like ladies when out. As the girls come of age, they are conflicted. They want to please mother by acting as her sons, but, suddenly smitten with three gentlemen, they are compelled to grow up and be ladies. When their suitors secretly come to woo, they aren’t sure what to do……and what will mother do if she finds out? (Summary by A.L.

Jim, by Joseph Conrad.Read by Stewart Wills.A classic of early literary modernism, Lord Jim tells the story of a young \"simple and sensitive character\" who loses his honor in a display of cowardice at sea -- and of his expiation of that sin against his own \"shadowy ideal of conduct\" on the remote island of Patusan. The novel, written by Conrad for magazine serialization during an intense and chaotic ten months in 1899 and 1900, has, in the words of Thomas C. Moser, \"the rare distinction of being a masterpiece in two separate genres. It is at once an exotic adventure story of the Eastern seas in the popular tradition of Kipling and Stevenson and a complexly wrought 'art novel' in the tradition of Flaubert and James.

The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River, and its sober and often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and freedom in all of American literature. The book has been popular with young readers since its publication, and taken as a sequel to the comparatively innocuous The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. It has also been the continued object of study by serious literary critics. Although the Southern society it satirized was already a quarter-century in the past by the time of publication, the book immediately became controversial, and has remained so to this day.

Frank Baum.\nThe Road to Oz takes Dorothy and her friends on an adventure in Oz to a grand party in honor of Ozma's birthday. It all starts near her home on Uncle Henry's farm in Kansas when she tries to help a shaggy stranger find the road he is seeking. On the way they find a young boy, Button-Bright, and together they get lost, only to find themselves in the fairylands of Oz.\nOnce again in the Land of Oz, Dorothy and her friends encounter a number of new fantasy characters: some good, some bad, some amusing, and all entertaining. They make their way eventually to the Emerald City to participate in Ozma's Birthday Celebration. In the end, Dorothy arrives safely back home, a little tired from her adventures, but quite content. \nReading by Kara Shallenberg\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.\n\nFor more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit LibriVox.org\n\nM4B audiobook of Complete Book\n","cover":"https://ia800501.us.archive.org/19/items/road_to_oz/Road_Oz_1108.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2005-10-17 11:50:22","Boxid":"OL100020306","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-17T12:44:00Z","Identifier":"road_to_oz","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"4:45:43","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              Librivox          ","Type":"sound","Year":"\n              2005          ","audios":[{"title":"The Way to Butterfield","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_01_baum.mp3"},{"title":"Dorothy Meets Button-Bright","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_02_baum.mp3"},{"title":"A Queer Village","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_03_baum.mp3"},{"title":"King Dox","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_04_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Rainbow's Daughter","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_05_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The City of Beasts","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_06_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Shaggy Man's Transformation","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_07_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Musicker","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_08_baum.mp3"},{"title":"Facing the Scoodlers","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_09_baum.mp3"},{"title":"Escaping the Soup Kettle","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_10_baum.mp3"},{"title":"Johnny Dooit Does It","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_11_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Deadly Desert Crossed","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_12_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Truth Pond","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_13_baum.mp3"},{"title":"Tik-Tok and Billina","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_14_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Emperor's Tin Castle","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_15_baum.mp3"},{"title":"Visiting the Pumpkin Field","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_16_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Royal Chariot Arrives","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_17_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Emerald City","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_18_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Shaggy Man's Welcome","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_19_baum.mp3"},{"title":"Princess Ozma of Oz","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_20_baum.mp3"},{"title":"Dorothy Receives the Guests","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_21_baum.mp3"},{"title":"Important Arrivals","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_22_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Grand Banquet","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_23_baum.mp3"},{"title":"The Birthday Celebration","source":"https://archive.org/download/road_to_oz/roadtoOz_24_baum.mp3"}]},{"title":"Die Leiden des jungen Werther","author":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","description":"Librivox recording of Die Leiden des jungen Werther, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.Read in German by Rainer.Die Leiden des jungen Werther beschreibt die unglückliche Liebe eines jungen Mannes (Werther) zu einer verlobten, später verheirateten Frau. Der Roman ist aus einer radikal subjektiven Perspektive geschrieben: er besteht nur aus Briefen von Werther vor allem an einen Freund namens Wilhelm. Erst im letzten Teil des zweiten Buches tritt ein Erzähler hinzu. Anhand der Briefe kann der Leser sowohl dem Verlauf der Handlung als auch den Gefühlen Werthers folgen, der immer verzweifelter wird, bis es schließlich in einer Katastrophe endet.Der Roman besteht aus zwei Büchern, die aber eher als zwei Teile eines einzigen Romans anzusehen sind.(Zusammenfassung von Rainer)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to find out how you can volunteer, please visit librivox.org.Buch als M4B verfügbar\n","cover":"https://ia800200.us.archive.org/30/items/leiden_werther_librivox/leiden_werther_1005.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-02-13 20:18:30","Boxid":"OL100020301","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-27T12:59:59Z","Identifier":"leiden_werther_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"4:56:56","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"01 - Briefe im Mai 1771","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/01_goethe_werther_mai_1771.mp3"},{"title":"02 - Briefe im Juni 1771","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/02_goethe_werther_juni_1771.mp3"},{"title":"03 - Briefe im Juli 1771","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/03_goethe_werther_juli_1771.mp3"},{"title":"04 - Briefe im August 1771","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/04_goethe_werther_august_1771.mp3"},{"title":"05 - Briefe im September 1771","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/05_goethe_werther_september_1771.mp3"},{"title":"06 - Briefe vom Oktober 1771 - April 1772","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/06_goethe_werther_oktober_1771-april_1772.mp3"},{"title":"07 - Briefe vom Mai - September 1772","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/07_goethe_werther_mai-september_1772.mp3"},{"title":"08 - Briefe vom Oktober - Dezember 1772","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/08_goethe_werther_oktober-dezember_1772.mp3"},{"title":"09 - Der Herausgeber an den Leser - Teil 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/09_goethe_werther_herausgeber_1.mp3"},{"title":"10 - Der Herausgeber an den Leser - Teil 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/10_goethe_werther_herausgeber_2.mp3"},{"title":"11 - Der Herausgeber an den Leser - Teil 3","source":"https://archive.org/download/leiden_werther_librivox/11_goethe_werther_herausgeber_3.mp3"}]},{"title":"Aesop's Fables, Volume 8 (Fables 176-200)","author":"Aesop","description":"Librivox recording of Aesop's Fables, Volume 8 (Fables 176-200).Dating back to the 6th century BC, Aesop's Fables tell universal truths through the use of simple allegories that are easily understood.

Porter","description":"LibriVox recording of POLLYANNA, by Eleanor H. Porter.Read by Phil Chenevert    In a small town far out West, 11 year old Pollyanna has lost both her mother then her dad to disease.  This book describes how the orphan is sent to be raised by her aunt who lives far away in the East of the country. Unfortunately her aunt does not want her but accepts her very reluctantly only out of 'duty' and sticks her into a tiny hot attic room so she will be 'out of the way'.  What Aunt Polly does not know is that Pollyanna is bringing the game of being 'glad' that her father taught her and that her irrepressibly happy attitude will transform not only that dull and miserable house, but an entire village before she is through. And just possibly, your life too!

It is one of the most influential works of philosophy and political theory, and arguably Plato's best known work. In it, Socrates and various other Athenians and foreigners discuss the meaning of justice and whether the just man is happier than the unjust man by constructing an imaginary city ruled by philosopher-kings. The dialogue also discusses the nature of the philosopher, Plato's Theory of Forms, the conflict between philosophy and poetry, and the immortality of the soul.

A man of the most repetitious and punctual habit - with no apparent sense of adventure whatsoever - he gambles his considerable fortune that he can complete a journey around the world in just 80 days... immediately after a newspaper calculates the feat as just barely possible. With his excitable French manservant in tow, Fogg undertakes the exercise immediately, with no preparations, trusting that his traveling funds will make up for delays along the way. But unbeknownst to him, British police are desperately seeking to arrest him for the theft of a huge sum by someone who resembles him, and they will track him around the world, if necessary, to apprehend him. This is an adventure novel of the first water, with wholly unexpected perils, hair-breadth escapes, brilliant solutions to insoluble problems, and even a love story. And can this be? - That he returns to London just five minutes too late to win his wager and retain his fortune?Summary and recording by Mark F.

Wilde later revised this edition, making several alterations, and adding new chapters; the amended version was published by Ward, Lock, and Company in April 1891. The novel tells of a young man named Dorian Gray, the subject of a painting by artist Basil Hallward. Basil is impressed by Dorian's beauty and becomes infatuated with him, believing his beauty is responsible for a new mode in his art. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil's, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry's world view. Espousing a new hedonism, Lord Henry suggests the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfillment of the senses. Realizing that one day his beauty will fade, Dorian (whimsically) expresses a desire to sell his soul to ensure the portrait Basil has painted would age rather than himself. Dorian's wish is fulfilled, plunging him into debauched acts. The portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul, with each sin displayed as a disfigurement of his form, or through a sign of aging. The Picture of Dorian Gray is considered a work of classic gothic fiction with a strong Faustian theme.

Read by Mark F. SmithBuck Duane, son of a famous gunfighter, falls prey to the old problem - called out by a cowboy who wants to make trouble, Duane kills him and then must ride off to the lawless country near the Neuces River to escape being arrested and perhaps, hanged. His brief encounter with deadly gunplay has ignited a deep urging to repeat the adrenaline rush but is tempered by ghosts that haunt his sleep. He only dares to release his inner demon when he is taking down an outlaw who is particularly known for his brutality.He develops a reputation for killing the most notorious Texas outlaws, which draws an unexpected interest: a captain of the Texas Rangers offers him a pardon and a ranger's badge if he will infiltrate the gang of the shadowy figure known as \"Cheseldine\" who wields vast power in West Texas, and make it possible for the Rangers to break the gang's hold on the region's towns. Duane accepts, never guessing in his wildest nightmares that he would sniff out this Cheseldine, his hideouts, his lieutenants... and fall in love with his daughter!  (Summary by Mark F.

This is a tough, literary journey. It was tough for Twain and his fellow “pilgrims”, both religious and otherwise. They set out, on a June day in 1867, to visit major tourist sites in Europe and the near east, including Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, “the Holy Land”, and Egypt. What Twain records, in often humorous, sometimes grotesque but always fascinating detail, are the day-to-day ups and downs of discovering the truth about people and places. The truths they learn are often far different than their education and rumor have made them preconceive.\nThis is a voyage of discovery. It’s long and, in places, tiresome. But it’s revelatory about so much. As with some of his other works, Twain includes popular prejudices of his time, which are today considered socially unacceptable. His references to “Indians”, “Negroes” and “infidels” come to mind.\nBeyond the lows, though, there are the highs of Twain’s cutting whit and insight as he guides us along the bumpy and often dangerous voyage.\nNo need to buckle up. Just take it slow, and steady…like the journey itself.

Park by Jane Austen. Read by Karen Savage.Miss Frances, the youngest Ward sister, \"married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her family, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly. She could hardly have made a more untoward choice.\" Some years later, pregnant with her ninth child, Mrs. Price appeals to her family, namely to her eldest sister and her husband, Sir Thomas Bertram, for help with her over-large family. Sir Thomas provides assistance in helping his nephews into lines of work suitable to their education, and takes his eldest niece, Fanny Price, then ten years old, into his home to raise with his own children. It is Fanny's story we follow in Mansfield Park.

In it, Aristotle explores the role that the political community should play in developing the virtue of its citizens. One of his central ideas is that \"Man is a political animal,\" meaning that people can only become virtuous by active participation in the political community. Aristotle also criticizes his teacher Plato, classifies and evaluates six different types of constitutions and political institutions, and describes his vision of the ideal state. Aristotle's views on women and slavery are unenlightened by today's standards, but his work remains enduring and relevant to this day.

Seventeen year-old Catherine spends her time visiting newly-made friends, such as Isabella Thorpe, and going to balls. Catherine finds herself pursued by Isabella's brother John Thorpe (Catherine's brother James's friend from university), and by Henry Tilney. She also becomes friends with Eleanor Tilney, Henry's younger sister. Henry captivates her with his view on novels and his knowledge of history and the world. General Tilney (Henry and Eleanor's father) invites Catherine to visit their estate, Northanger Abbey, which, because she has been reading Ann Radcliffe's gothic novel The Mysteries of Udolpho, Catherine expects to be dark, ancient and full of fantastical mystery.

Read by Paul Adams.A Tale of Two Cities (1859) is a novel by Charles Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution. With well over 200 million copies sold, it is among the most famous works of fiction.The novel depicts the plight of the French peasantry demoralized by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution, the corresponding brutality demonstrated by the revolutionaries toward the former aristocrats in the early years of the revolution, and many unflattering social parallels with life in London during the same time period. It follows the lives of several protagonists through these events. The most notable are Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. Darnay is a French once-aristocrat who falls victim to the indiscriminate wrath of the revolution despite his virtuous nature, and Carton is a dissipated British barrister who endeavours to redeem his ill-spent life out of his unrequited love for Darnay's wife, Lucie Manette.

Departing from literary convention, Kate Chopin failed to condemn her heroine’s desire for an affair with the son of a Louisiana resort owner, whom she meets on vacation. The power of sensuality, the delusion of ecstatic love, and the solitude that accompanies the trappings of middle- and upper-class life are the themes of this now-classic novel.” - As Kay Gibbons points out, Chopin “was writing American realism before most Americans could bear to hear that they were living it.”To give you an idea of the subject matter, Project Gutenburg catalogues The Awakening under “Adultery — Fiction — Women — Louisiana — New Orleans — Social conditions.” (Summary by Denny Sayers)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.M4B format available\n","cover":"https://ia802604.us.archive.org/13/items/awakening_librivox/awakening_1006.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-11-28 08:35:08","Boxid":"OL100020304","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-11T00:11:17Z","Identifier":"awakening_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"4:47:49","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"Section 01","source":"https://archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_01_chopin.mp3"},{"title":"Section 02","source":"https://archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_02_chopin.mp3"},{"title":"Section 03","source":"https://archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_03_chopin.mp3"},{"title":"Section 04","source":"https://archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_04_chopin.mp3"},{"title":"Section 05","source":"https://archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_05_chopin.mp3"},{"title":"Section 06","source":"https://archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_06_chopin.mp3"},{"title":"Section 07","source":"https://archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_07_chopin.mp3"},{"title":"Section 08","source":"https://archive.org/download/awakening_librivox/awakening_08_chopin.mp3"}]},{"title":"The Junior Classics","author":"William Patten","description":"LibriVox recording of The Junior Classics Volume 1 by William Patten.The purpose of The Junior Classics is to provide, in ten volumes containing about five thousand pages, a classified collection of tales, stories, and poems, both ancient and modern, suitable for boys and girls of from six to sixteen years of age.

Walton sets out to explore the North Pole and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame and friendship. The ship becomes trapped in ice, and, one day, the crew sees a dog sled in the distance, on which there is the figure of a giant man. Hours later, the crew finds a frozen and emaciated man, Victor Frankenstein, in desperate need of sustenance. Frankenstein had been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton's crew when all but one of his dogs died. He had broken apart his dog sled to make oars and rowed an ice-raft toward the vessel. Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion and recounts his story to Walton. Before beginning his story, Frankenstein warns Walton of the wretched effects of allowing ambition to push one to aim beyond what one is capable of achieving. In telling his story to the captain, Frankenstein finds peace within himself.

He was a journalist, a poet and a novelist. He wrote 80 books and 200 short stories in addition to his other work. He is perhaps best remembered for his ‘Father Brown’ stories; two collections of which are available at Librivox.org.‘The Man Who Knew Too Much’ has some similarities to the Father Brown stories: Horne Fisher the eponymous hero is connected and indeed related to many of the high-ranking politicians of his age and thus ‘knows too much’ about the background of the mysteries in which he becomes embroiled and which he unravels.

Funny and sometimes bizarre observations are sprinkled throughout. In keeping with LibriVox policy to read, rather than attempt to rewrite, books - even those with offensive content - nothing has been omitted. While many of the definitions may just seem confusing or \"corny\" to modern readers, there are a couple that also might be considered \"objectionable,\" particularly in section 10, which contains offensive content of a racial nature.

Read by Mark F. Smith.\n\nShipwrecked and castaway, Daniel DeFoe’s hard-luck character is still the standard for “growing where you’re planted.” Captured by pirates, he makes his break in a small boat and undergoes desperate adventures before winning his way back to civilization. But Crusoe proves willing to chance his luck a second time when, after sweating his way to prosperity as a planter in Brazil, he undertakes a voyage that isn’t needful… and is marooned on a small island off South America.Crusoe shows the value of single-minded labor as he pursues ways to feed, shelter, and clothe himself. His ardent wish is to escape his island – why is it that the only people who come there are cannibals? But he spends more than two decades in isolation before acquiring a sidekick – the man Friday you’ve probably heard of. And who would guess his way to salvation would depend on leading a last-ditch fight against a shipful of mutineers?For other castaway stories inspired by “Robinson Crusoe”, listen to “The Swiss Family Robinson” (http://snipurl.com/swiss_family) and “The Mysterious Island” (http://snipurl.com/mysterious_island).

In some ways this is a heavy text, laden with conversational philosophizing; but the vividness of the narrator make it a wonderful read, and funny.(Review by Hugh McGuire)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit LibriVox.org.Download M4B (141MB)\n","cover":"https://ia600307.us.archive.org/1/items/notes_from_the_underground/Notes_Underground_1108.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2005-10-19 18:46:40","Boxid":"OL100020210","Identifier":"notes_from_the_underground","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"5:06:29","Source":"\n              LibriVox recording of Gutenberg e-text          ","Type":"sound","Year":"\n              2005          ","audios":[{"title":"notes_p1_ch_01","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_01_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p1_ch_02","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_02_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p1_ch_03","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_03_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p1_ch_04","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_04_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p1_ch_05","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_05_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p1_ch_06","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_06_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p1_ch_07","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_07_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p1_ch_08","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_08_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p1_ch_09","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_09_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p1_ch_10-11","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p1_10-11_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_ch_01","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_01_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_ch_02","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_02_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_ch_03","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_03_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_ch_04","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_04_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_ch_05","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_05_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_ch_06","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_06_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_ch_07","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_07_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_ch_08","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_08_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_ch_09","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_09_dostoyevsky.mp3"},{"title":"notes_p2_10","source":"https://archive.org/download/notes_from_the_underground/notes_p2_10_dostoyevsky.mp3"}]},{"title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (solo version 2)","author":"L.

It is one of the best-known stories in American popular culture and has been widely translated. This is the first of thirteen more Oz books.

What great cause is he identified with?’    ‘He’s identified,’ said the speaker, ‘with the great cause of cheering us all up’.” (summary by Andy Minter)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more information, or to volunteer, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B (220MB)\n","cover":"https://ia802801.us.archive.org/13/items/the_card_librivox/Card_1105.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-09-07 00:33:15","Boxid":"OL100020016","Identifier":"the_card_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"7:58:21","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"Chapter 01 - The Dance","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_01_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 02 - The Widow Hullin's House","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_02_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 03 - The Pantechnicol","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_03_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 04 - The Wrecking of a Life","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_04_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 05 - The Mercantile Marine","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_05_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 06 - His Burglary","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_06_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 07 - The Rescuer of Dames","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_07_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 08 - Raising a Wigwam","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_08_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 09 - The Great Newspaper War","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_09_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 10 - His Infamy","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_10_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 11 - In the Alps","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_11_bennett.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 12 - The Supreme Honour","source":"https://archive.org/download/the_card_librivox/the_card_12_bennett.mp3"}]},{"title":"Life of Jesse Harding Pomeroy","author":"E. Luscomb Haskell","description":"LibriVox recording of Life of Jesse Harding Pomeroy by E. Luscomb Haskell.  Read in English by Roger Melin \"The Life of Jesse Harding Pomeroy: The Most Remarkable Case in the History of Crime or Criminal Law\" by E. Luscomb Haskell was published in Boston, Massachusetts in 1892 by the Harvard Law School Library, and is part of \"The Making of the Modern Law, Legal Treatises, 1800-1926\" series. Remarkable insight into the life of Pomeroy prior to, during, and following the crimes for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment at the tender age of 14, this is an excellent complement to Pomeroy's \"autobiography\" which was published immediately following his trial in 1874. The advantages offered by this short book are that it was researched and published less than twenty years after the trial and conviction; that the accused was still alive at the time of publication; and that a large amount relates to the legal perspective of one of the most fascinating and confounding episodes of American criminology. Jesse Harding Pomeroy was sentenced to life in prison in 1874 at the age of 14 for the commission of two murders, and has therefore been referred to as \"America's youngest serial killer\" to this day. Other books have been written about Pomeroy over the years, as it makes for a most interesting character study, in addition to its legal implications, journalistic influence, and the effect of public outcry for justice and safety were preeminent. - Summary by Roger Melin For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

The unnamed narrator tells his dreams to a friend, Severin, who tells him how to break him of his fascination with cruel women by reading a manuscript, Memoirs of a Supersensual Man.This manuscript tells of a man, Severin von Kusiemski, so infatuated with a woman, Wanda von Dunajew, that he requests to be treated as her slave, and encourages her to treat him in progressively more degrading ways. At first Wanda does not understand or relate to the request, but after humouring Severin a bit she finds the advantages of the method to be interesting and enthusiastically embraces the idea; though at the same time, she disdains Severin for allowing her to do so.

Published serially in 1862, it tells the story of the lovely Lucy Graham, who becomes Lady Audley at the beginning of the novel, and who conceals a scandalous secret from her new husband and his family. The plot, which includes madness, bigamy, attempted murder, and seduction, made this a shocking but highly successful story for Victorian audiences. It remains one of the best examples of 19th century sensational fiction, and is a wonderfully absorbing book.Read by Elizabeth Klett.For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (137MB)Download M4B Part 2 (133MB)Download M4B Part 3 (125MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800707.us.archive.org/31/items/lady_audleys_secret_ek_librivox/Lady_Audleys_Secret.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-09-25 10:35:17","Boxid":"OL100020312","Identifier":"lady_audleys_secret_ek_librivox","Runtime":"14:16:45","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"01 -

Der Erzähler aber nimmt die Gestalt während eines Sturmes wahr, ohne je davor von ihr gehört zu haben.Da der Sturm zunimmt, sucht er Zuflucht in dem Gasthaus des Dorfes. Dort berichtet ihm der Schulmeister das Schicksal Hauke Haiens, des einstigen Deichgrafen, den sein hartes Schicksal zum „Schimmelreiter” machte.

Consequently, great historical names alone are selected; and it has been the writer's aim to present the prominent and leading traits in their characters, and all the important events in their lives, in a bold and free manner, and yet in the plain and simple language which is so obviously required in works which aim at permanent and practical usefulness. This volume is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth.

He was a man who seemed to know everything about human nature and as Orson Welles said 'he speaks to everyone and we all claim him'. I know that it has been said that 'it is impossible to be a great Shakespearian actor without an idiosyncratic and extraordinary voice' and this may be so, but that does not preclude ordinary mortals from reading, hearing and enjoying Shakespeare.

Read by Tom Weiss.It is the end of the 19th century. Like thousands of others, the Rudkus family has emigrated from Lithuania to America in search of a better life. As they settle into the Packingtown neighborhood of Chicago, they find their dreams are unlikely to be realized. In fact, just the opposite is quite likely to occur. Jurgis, the main character of the novel, has brought his father Antanas, his fiancée Ona, her stepmother Teta Elzbieta, Teta Elzbieta's brother Jonas and her six children, and Ona's cousin Marija Berczynskas along. The family, naïve to the ways of Chicago, quickly falls prey to con men and makes a series of bad decisions that lead them into wretched poverty and terrible living conditions. All are forced to find jobs in dismal working conditions for their very survival. Jurgis, broken and discouraged, eventually finds solace in the American Socialist movement.This novel was written during a period in American history when “Trusts” were formed by multiple corporations to establish monopolies that stifled competition and fixed prices. Unthinkable working conditions and unfair business practices were the norm. The Jungle’s author, Upton Sinclair, was an ardent Socialist of the time. Sinclair was commissioned by the “Appeal To Reason”, a Socialist journal of the period, to write a fictional expose on the working conditions of the immigrant laborers in the meat packing industry in Chicago. Going undercover, Sinclair spent seven weeks inside the meatpacking plants gathering details for his novel.The Reader wishes to gratefully acknowledge the assistance, and patience, of Professor Giedrius Subacius (University of Illinois) and the folks at Lituanus (www.lituanus.org) for their invaluable support as I struggled with Lithuanian pronunciations. Truly, this audio book would have been far more difficult, and far less authentic, without their help.And now, feel free to wander into The Jungle…….(Summary by Tom Weiss)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit LibriVox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (107MB)Download M4B Part 2 (114MB)Download M4B Part 3 (112MB)Download M4B Part 4 (105MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800202.us.archive.org/4/items/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/Jungle_the_1003.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2009-08-13 06:42:25","Boxid":"OL100020511","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-29T05:51:17Z","Identifier":"jungle_tw_0908_librivox","Runtime":"16:02:48","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2009          ","audios":[{"title":"Chapter 01","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_01_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 02","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_02_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 03","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_03_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 04","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_04_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 05","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_05_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 06","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_06_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 07","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_07_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 08","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_08_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 09","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_09_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 10","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_10_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 11","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_11_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 12","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_12_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 13","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_13_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 14","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_14_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 15","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_15_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 16","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_16_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 17","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_17_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 18","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_18_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 19","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_19_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 20","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_20_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 21","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_21_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 22","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_22_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 23","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_23_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 24","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_24_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 25","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_25_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 26","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_26_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 27","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_27_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 28","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_28_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 29","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_29_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 30","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_30_sinclair.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 31","source":"https://archive.org/download/jungle_tw_0908_librivox/thejungle_31_sinclair.mp3"}]},{"title":"An Englishwoman's Love-Letters","author":"Anonymous","description":"Librivox recording of An Englishwoman's Love-Letters by Anonymous read by Esther.It need hardly be said that the woman by whom these letter were written had no thought that they would be read by anyone but the person to whom they were addressed.

More than three years later, he returned to Newport, Rhode Island, on June 27, 1898 having circumnavigated the world, a distance of 46,000 miles (74,000 km).In 1899 he described the voyage in Sailing Alone Around the World now considered a classic of travel literature.

Aparece también Aviraneta, y tendremos noticias de su niñez y primera juventud en Madrid, Pamplona y Guipúzcoa.  En este relato el autor explica cómo han llegado a sus manos los cuadernos de don Pello de Leguía y Gaztelumendi, que constituyen precisamente el texto de las Memorias de un hombre de acción; Explica igualmente por qué al final se ha decidido a dar esos cuadernos a la imprenta y cómo, cuando el editor tuerce el gesto al ver el nombre de Leguía, determina aparecer él mismo como autor, aunque, para que no le remuerda del todo la conciencia, añade al texto algunas disgresiones. - Summary by http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2440739.El_aprendiz_ For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

James.\n\nMontague Rhodes James (1862-1936) was a medieval scholar; Provost of King's College, Cambridge. He wrote many of his ghost stories to be read aloud in the long tradition of spooky Christmas Eve tales. His stories often use rural settings, with a quiet, scholarly protagonist getting caught up in the activities of supernatural forces. The details of horror are almost never explicit, the stories relying on a gentle, bucolic background to emphasise the awfulness of the otherworldly intrusions.\n\n\"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\" was written as two collections, presented here as two volumes in a single work.

The Hound of the Baskervilles - Pies Baskerville'ów) - powieść detektywistyczna sir Artura Conan Doyle'a, wydana w czasopiśmie The Strand Magazine w latach 1901-1902 (wydanie polskie 1902). Jedna z najsłynniejszych pozycji, należących do cyklu opowieści o detektywie Sherlocku Holmesie. Jej akcja rozgrywa się na ponurych wrzosowiskach hrabstwa Devon.\nPowieść zaczyna się przyjazdem dr Mortimera do Londynu na Baker Street. Lekarz opowiada Sherlockowi Holmesowi i Watsonowi historię o psie. W tajemniczych okolicznościach giną kolejni spadkobiercy majątku Baskerville'ów. Miejscowa ludność przypisuje owe zagadkowe zgony działaniu klątwy, prześladującej od ponad dwustu lat rodzinę Baskerville'ów. Holmes wysyła Watsona wraz z przybyłym zza oceanu, ostatnim spadkobiercą, sir Henrym, do posiadłości Baskerville'ów. Tam przez długi czas Watson odkrywa kolejne elementy zagadki i dzieli się z Holmesem zdobytą wiedzą.(Wstęp z Wikipedii)\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.\n\nFor more free audiobooks or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org\n\nM4B Audiobook (115MB)\n","cover":"https://ia601901.us.archive.org/0/items/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnica_baskervillow_1303.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2013-02-28 10:25:14","Boxid":"OL100020016","Identifier":"tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox","Runtime":"4:16:33","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2013          ","audios":[{"title":"01 - Pan Sherlock Holmes.","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_01_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"02 - Przekleństwo rodu Baskerville.","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_02_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"03 - Zagadka","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_03_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"04 - Sir Henryk Baskerville","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_04_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"05 - Trzy nici urwane","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_05_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"06 - Baskerville Hall","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_06_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"07 - Stapleton z Merripit-House","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_07_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"08 - Pierwsze sprawozdanie doktora Watson","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_08_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"09 - Światło na bagnie (Drugie sprawozdanie doktora Watsona)","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_09_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"10 - Wyjątek z dziennika doktora Watsona","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_10_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"11 - Nieznajomy, ukrywający się w jaskini","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_11_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"12 - Śmierć na bagnie","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_12_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"13 - Zastawianie sieci","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_13_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"14 - Pies Baskerville'ów","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_14_doyle.mp3"},{"title":"15 - Rzut oka wstecz","source":"https://archive.org/download/tajemnica_baskervile_1302_librivox/tajemnicabaskervillow_15_doyle.mp3"}]},{"title":"The Money Moon: A Romance","author":"Jeffery Farnol","description":"LibriVox recording of The Money Moon: A Romance, by Jeffery Farnol.

Chesteron.Read by Brian Roberg.The Innocence of Father Brown (1911) is the first of five collections of mystery stories by G. K. Chesterton starring an unimposing but surprisingly capable Roman Catholic priest. Father Brown's ability to uncover the truth behind the mystery continually surpasses that of the \"experts\" around him, who are fooled into underestimation by the priest's unimpressive outward appearance and, often, by their own prejudices about Christianity. Combining captivating stories and insightful commentary, The Innocence of Father Brown is a delightful read.

Smith\n\nThis much-loved story follows a group of animal friends in the English countryside as they pursue adventure ... and as adventure pursues them!  The chief characters - Mole, Rat, and Toad - generally lead upbeat and happy lives, but their tales are leavened with moments of terror, homesickness, awe, madcap antics, and derring-do.Although classed as children's literature, The Wind in the Willows holds a gentle fascination for adults too.  The vocabulary is decidedly not \"Dick and Jane\", and a reader with a love of words will find new ones to treasure, even if well-equipped for the journey.  Parents will appreciate the themes of loyalty, manners, self-restraint, and comradeship which are evident throughout the book.  When the characters err, they are prompt to acknowlege it, and so a reading of this book can model good behavior to children, who will otherwise be enchanted with the many ways in which the lives of these bucolic characters differ from modern life.This book was so successful that it enabled the author to retire from banking and take up a country life somewhat like that of his creations.  It has been adapted for screen, stage, and even a ride at the original Disneyland.(Summary by Mark F.

Its translation into rhyming couplets by Alexander Pope is considered by some the greatest act of translation in English. Its power sweeps the reader along through an epic tale that begins with the wrath of Achilles and ends with the burial of Hector, breaker of horses.

Leído en español por Victor Villarraza.Los Viajes de Gulliver pertenece al género fantástico y es unn serie de viajes imaginarios, que leídos en profundidad, constituye una de las mejores sátiras que se han escrito. Swift escribió los Viajes de Gulliver, desde la experiencia de Swift con los Tories y sus conflictos con los Whigs, estas disputas fueron la causa para escribir libros que burlando la opinión religiosa, gubernamental o popular, ponían en evidencia los diferentes puntos de vista entre ellos y con él mismo.La obra relata los cuatro viajes por mar, realizados por un médico de abordo llamado Lemuel Gulliver. A través de Gullliver, J.Swift en sus cuatro viajes por diferentes países, representa cada uno, una parte corrupta de Inglaterra. Swift critica al gobierno, la sociedad, la ciencia y la religión. No solamente hace crítica de las costumbres de cada país, sino que además se burla del hombre ingenuo, quien tiene la incapacidad para figurarse el doble sentido de las cosas.

Read by John Lieder.The Adventures of Reddy Fox is another in the series of children’s stories by conservationist Thornton W. Burgess. In this story, Reddy and Granny Fox must outsmart Farmer Brown’s Boy who is out to get Reddy for stealing his pet chicken. Along the way, Reddy encounters many of the citizens of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest and with him we learn little lessons about life such as: the perils of being a show off; the importance of using all of one’s senses; that it is a fine thing to show sympathy and kindness to others – even our enemies; and that the value of a grandmother’s wisdom is inestimable.We also learn that after you’ve stolen a boy’s pet chicken and he is coming your way with a gun, a shovel and a hound dog, it may be time to beat a hasty retreat.

The place is Canaan which is the land of Israel and the adjoining nations. The Book discusses the complex relationship between God and Mankind and portrays the travails of one particular family, the family of Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.The book is priceless in its description of the custom of the day and the interaction within the family, tribe and Nation. But most of all the beauty of Genesis lies in the description of human behavior from its petty jealousies through unrelenting commitment for a worthy cause and love for family and friends.We follow the trials and tribulation of the main characters as they deal with adverse circumstances and at times global annihilation. Important part of the book is also the recounting of the genealogy of the people from Adam and Eve to Joseph in Egypt. A connection is made to other different nations and tribes.The Hebrew language is the original language of the Bible. Although Hebrew went through several transformations so far as the shape of the Alphabet, the text is consistent.For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds,

This is the second half of the book.  The first half can be found here:Our Island Story, Part 1Read by Jim Mowatt and Kara ShallenbergOur Island Story was first published in 1905 and became an instant classic. Beginning with the Romans and following the triumphs and foibles of the good, not so good and the downright despicable figures of history; we are treated to a dazzling montage of kings, queens, barons, knights, explorers, movers and shakers that have played a key role in the history of England. Marshall freely mixes folk tale with historical fact and in so doing paints a very vivid picture of the past in a style reminiscent of all that is finest in the children’s story telling tradition.This is the second section of that work and will carry you from the convoluted and bloody 'Wars of the Roses' up to the death of Queen Victoria and the resolution of the Boer War. Please be advised that this book was written in the early years of the 20th century and there will be words and phrases used then, in all innocence, that are considered politically incorrect in this age. It's perfectly fine for children to listen to but please ensure there is someone on hand who can explain these terms in a mature fashion.(Summary by Jim)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.Download M4B Part 1 (137MB)Download M4B Part 2 (80MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800207.us.archive.org/6/items/our_island_story_2_librivox/ourislandstory2_1012.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-09-11 14:36:08","Boxid":"OL100020215","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-31T04:37:12Z","Identifier":"our_island_story_2_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"300","Runtime":"7:48:36","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"055 -

(Translated by Frederic Henry Hedge.) Read in English by Mihai Borobocea; Ashley M.; Megan Lam; James K. White Peter Schlemihl is an ordinary man until one day he bargains with the devil: He trades his shadow for a bottomless purse. While this sounds like a good idea at first, it turns out that having no shadow is considered to be so strange by society, that even unlimited wealth cannot repair such a fault. The story of Peter Schlemihl is exceedingly well-known even today, but the original text is not so widely-read as it once was. This very accessible translation by F.H. Hedge may be a good introduction to modern listeners. - Summary by Carolin For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

Jerome","description":"LibriVox recording of Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog), by Jerome K. Jerome.Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog), published in 1889, is a humorous account by Jerome K. Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford. The book was intended initially to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history of places along the route, but the humorous elements eventually took over, to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages now seem like an unnecessary distraction to the essentially comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers. The jokes seem fresh and witty even today. The three men were based on Jerome himself and two real-life friends, George, and Harris. The dog, Montmorency, however, was entirely fictional, but, as Jerome had remarked, \"had much of me in it.\" (Summary from Wikipedia)M4B audiobook of complete book\n","cover":"https://ia802908.us.archive.org/1/items/three_men_boat_librivox/Three_Men_in_a_Boat_1007.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-03-30 00:16:01","Boxid":"OL100020300","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-16T00:01:19Z","Identifier":"three_men_boat_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"6:38:44","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"01 - Chapter One","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_01_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"02 - Chapter Two","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_02_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"03 - Chapter Three","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_03_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"04 - Chapter Four","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_04_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"05 - Chapter Five","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_05_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"06 - Chapter Six","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_06_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"07 - Chapter Seven","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_07_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"08 - Chapter Eight","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_08_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"09 - Chapter Nine","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_09_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"10 - Chapter Ten","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_10_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"11 - Chapter Eleven","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_11_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"12 - Chapter Twelve","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_12_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"13 - Chapter Thirteen","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_13_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"14 - Chapter Fourteen","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_14_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"15 - Chapter Fifteen","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_15_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"16 - Chapter Sixteen","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_16_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"17 - Chapter Seventeen","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_17_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"18 - Chapter Eighteen","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_18_jerome.mp3"},{"title":"19 - Chapter Nineteen","source":"https://archive.org/download/three_men_boat_librivox/3meninaboat_19_jerome.mp3"}]},{"title":"Theodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography","author":"Theodore Roosevelt","description":"LibriVox recording of Theodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography read by LibriVox volunteers.In his vital, illustrative and dynamic autobiography, Theodore Roosevelt let us into the life that formed one of the greatest and outspoken presidents in American history.

She becomes governess to a little girl at Thornfield Hall and falls in love with the brooding, Byronic master, Mr. Rochester: a man who hides a terrible secret in Thornfield’s attic.

(Translated by Manuel Caballero.) Read in Spanish by Victor VillarrazaLa Isla del Tesoro es una narración llana, un romance fácil, un cuento sabroso con un niño por héroe, y que, á pesar de sus peripecias dramáticas y conmovedoras, conserva en todo el discurso del libro una pureza y una sencillez tales que no habrá hogar, por mucha severidad que impere en él, del cual pueda desterrársele con razón. Stevenson se propuso, además, describir con esa difícil facilidad que parece ser un secreto suyo, esas escenas y aventuras marinas en que el lector percibe, desprendiéndose de la sencilla narración, ya el olor acre de las brisas de la playa, ya el rumor de la pleamar deshaciéndose contra las rocas, ya el eco monótono de los cantos de marineros y grumetes empeñados en la maniobra. La fábula es sencilla pero perfectamente verosímil; con sólo que se recuerden los horrores que realizaron en los mares que dividen el Antiguo del Nuevo Continente aquellas hordas de piratas ingleses que tantas veces abordaron las naos de Nueva España y del Perú, se comprende la posibilidad de ese feroz Capitán Flint que, tras de adquirir un tesoro por la rapiña y la audacia, lo esconde en el corazón de una isla desierta para excitar con él, á su muerte, la avaricia y la sed de oro de sus mismos cómplices. - Summary by Manuel Caballero (Traductor) For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

Read by Leonard Wilson.The Amoretti (little love poems) is a sequence of 89 sonnets written in the tradition of the Petrarchan sonnets, a popular form for poets of the Renaissance period. Spenser’s sequence has been largely neglected in modern times, while those of his contemporaries William Shakespeare and Sir Philip Sidney have been acclaimed. However, because of the artistic skill, along with the emotion and the humor exhibited, these poems deserve a broader hearing, even though they may be somewhat difficult for the present-day reader, partly through Spenser’s love for words and expressions that were already archaic in his time. Amoretti, written throughout the year 1594 and published the following year, violates at least one of the conventional elements of the Renaissance sonnet sequences. Other poets, including Petrarch and Sidney, chose as the inspiration for their sonnets a woman who was inaccessible to the poet, sometimes even married to someone else. They idealized this woman, seeming to be extravagantly suffering because of their passionate admiration, while in real life they might hardly know the lady and had no real interest in an actual love affair. Spenser, however, dedicated his verses to a woman that he actually loved and sought, Elizabeth Boyle, whom he then married. Also the sonnet series by other poets were usually despairing of any fruition in regard to the lady, and Spenser certainly does show much frustration himself in his efforts to achieve a closer relationship with his love; but as the series progresses, he gradually sees improvement in the success of his wooing, as his actual wedding nears. The poems feature elaborate imagery, loaded with metaphorical situations, saying much the same thing repeatedly in a wide variety of ways, with much clever creativity, sometimes impressive and sometimes a bit awkward. There is a rich vein of humor running through the whole sequence, often through mock passion, and there is even a bit of sensuality in some of the later sonnets. The better poems are often sharp and crystalline, sparkling in their freshness and originality.

Though the basic plot is rather simple, even archetypal, the novel's true art lies in its details and hidden patterns. Flaubert was notoriously perfectionist about his writing and claimed to always be searching for le mot juste (the right word)\".

(Translated by Constance Garnett.) Read in English by Expatriate \"Crime and Punishment\" is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It was first published in the literary journal \"The Russian Messenger\" in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It was later published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoyevsky's full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the first great novel of his \"mature\" period of writing. \"Crime and Punishment\" focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a worthless vermin. He also commits this murder to test his own hypothesis that some people are naturally capable of such things, and even have the right to do them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov justifies his actions by comparing himself with Napoleon Bonaparte, believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose. Much of the suspense of the novel is psychological, as the reader agonizes over Raskolnikov's efforts to evade justice for his crime. Much of it is also moral, as the question of whether or not Raskolnikov himself can find redemption as a human being leads to a surprising culmination. - Summary by Wikipedia (edited by Expatriate) For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

Bird","description":"LibriVox recording of Unbeaten Tracks in Japan, by Isabella L. Bird.Read by Availle.Isabella Lucy Bird (1831 – 1904) was a 19th century English traveller, writer, and natural historian. She was a sickly child, however, while she was travelling she was almost always healthy. Her first trip, in 1854, took her to America, visiting relatives. Her first book, The Englishwoman in America was published anonymously two years later.Unbeaten Tracks in Japan is compiled of the letters she sent to her sister during her 7 months sojourn in Japan in 1878. Her travels there took her from Edo (now called Tokyo) through the interior - where she was often the first foreigner the locals had met - to Niigata, and from there to Aomori. There she crossed over to Yezo (Hokkaido), and her account on the life of the Ainu, an indigenous people of Japan, provides an interesting glimpse of days long past.

There are also links to the texts in Chinese and English.\n\nThe Tang Dynasty (618 to 907) was a golden age of Chinese culture: religion and philosophy, painting and calligraphy, sculpture, architecture and music all reached peaks of perfection. Poetry was the epitome of the arts: a scholastic requirement, a route to fame, a moulder of character. Nearly 50,000 poems of the Tang have survived. The collection 'Three Hundred Tang Poems' was compiled around 1763. It comprises six volumes, with poems grouped by verse form. Volume 1 covers the 'ancient verse' style in five-character lines (poems 1 to 35), and 'folk song style verse' (36 to 45). The masters Li Bai, Du Fu and Wang Wei are well represented here.  \n\nRecordings in this volume are in Cantonese, Hokkien, Mandarin and Taiwanese, as indicated in the titles; some are spoken, others are sung. \n\n(Summary by David Barnes)\n\nFor more information on LibriVox, or to volunteer, please see: http://librivox.org/\n\nM4B format

recording of As You Like It, by William Shakespeare.One of Shakespeare’s most popular plays, As You Like It is a pastoral comedy of mistaken identity, wit, and love. Daughter of a banished duke and forced to flee the court, Rosalind hides in the Forest of Arden disguised as a man. When her true love Orlando also shows up in the forest, she courts him without revealing her identity. Meanwhile, Phebe mistakenly falls in love with her disguise, Silvius pines for Phebe, Jacques philosophizes, and Touchstone makes fun of it all, and love and happiness triumph (for the most part) as Rosalind orchestrates a happy ending amid the confusion.

Smith\"Which of us lives on twenty-four hours a day? And when I say 'lives,' I do not mean exists, nor 'muddles through.'\"Arnold Bennett knew a \"rat race\" when he saw one. Every day, his fellow white-collar Londoners followed the same old routine. And they routinely decried the sameness in their lives. So Bennett set out to explain how to inject new enthusiasm into living. In this delightful little work, he taught his fellow sufferers how to set time apart for improving their lives. Yes, he assured them, it could be done. Yes, if you want to feel connected with the world, instead of endlessly pacing the treadmill (or, \"exceeding your programme\", as he called it), you must do so.For time, as he gleefully notes, is the ultimate democracy. Each of us starts our day with 24 hours to spend. Even a saint gets not a minute more; even the most inveterate time-waster is docked not a second for his wastrel ways. And he can choose today to turn over a new leaf!Bennett believed that learning to discern cause and effect in the world would give his readers an endless source of enjoyment and satisfaction. Instead of only being able to discuss what they had heard, they could graduate to what they thought... and lift themselves completely from the deadening influence of a day at the office.

Merriam","description":"LibriVox recording of A-Birding on a Bronco by Florence A. Merriam. Read by J. M. SmallheerFlorence Augusta Merriam Bailey (August 8, 1863 - September 22, 1948) was an American ornithologist and nature writer. She started observing bird behavior at a time when most bird study was based on collections and skins. By 1885, she began to write articles focusing on protecting birds. Her introduction of a birdwatching field guide, aimed at living birds, is considered the first in the tradition of modern bird guides.

We meet Miss Lucretia Lane as she is dressing for her marriage to Captain Francis Reynolds of the British Merchant Service. Though he loves her truly, she has severe misgivings. She goes through with the wedding in spite of this, but refuses to live with her new husband, and cannot be enticed or cajoled to do so. Then on the day the Captain is scheduled to ship out, she receives word that he has been gravely injured and his dying request is to see his wife. She flies to his side... and thus begins an adventure spanning eight years - love, loathing, shipwreck, love lost, and redemption. (Summary by P.

Fue publicada por entregas en el The Strand Magazine entre 1901 y 1902. La novela está principalmente ambientada en Dartmoor, en Devon en el Condado Oeste de Inglaterra. Conan Doyle escribió esta historia poco después de regresar de Sudáfrica, donde había trabajado como voluntario médico en The Langman Field Hospital en Bloemfontein. Fue asistido en el argumento por un periodista de 30 años de edad del Daily Express llamado Bertram Fletcher Robinson (1870-1907). Sus ideas provienen de la leyenda de Richard Cabell, que fue la inspiración de la leyenda de los Baskerville. Su tumba se puede ver en un pueblo llamado Buckfastleigh.

It was written by Thucydides, an Athenian general who served in the war. It is widely considered a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history.

Frank Baum","description":"Librivox recording of Sky Island, by L. Frank Baum.Read by Judy BieberSky Island (1912) was the second of three titles written by Baum featuring a spunky girl from California, Trot, and her companion, the old sailorman, Cap'n Bill. Baum had hoped to end the Oz series in 1910 and the following year he introduced Trot and Cap'n Bill in The Sea Fairies. In Sky Island, they journey to an island in the sky by means of an enchanted umbrella belonging to Button Bright, a character who first appeared in The Road to Oz (1909). The trio is then captured by the Boolaroo of the Blues, a monarch who is both comical and dangerous, escape to the country of the \"Pinks,\" and eventually regain the magic umbrella and return back to earth. This is one of Baum's best fantasy books and contains enough not-so-veiled commentary on race and politics to interest adults as well.

Dick","description":"LibriVox recording of MR. SPACESHIP, by PHILIP K. DICKRead by Phil Chenevert The war with the Yucks from Proxima Centauri was claimed to be a stalemate but they were really winning. The mine belts they laid seemed to propagate themselves and were slowly strangling Terran planets. How did they do that? What was their secret?

So, the next desperate step was to ask \"If they are using organic ships, why can't we do the same?\". Thus Mr. Spaceship was conceived and carried out. But will a conscious warship do what the generals wish? Perhaps and perhaps something entirely surprising!

Read by Eric Leach\n\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly shortened to Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 novel written by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures. The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends. The tale plays with logic in ways that have given the story lasting popularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the \"literary nonsense\" genre, and its narrative course and structure have been enormously influential, especially in the fantasy genre.

Read by Bob Neufeld.Heart of Darkness is a novella written by Joseph Conrad. Before its 1903 publication, it appeared as a three-part series (1899) in Blackwood's Magazine. It was classified by the Modern Library website editors as one of the \"100 best novels\" and part of the Western canon. The story centres on Charles Marlow, who narrates most of the book. He is an Englishman who takes a foreign assignment from a Belgian trading company as a river-boat captain in Africa. Heart of Darkness exposes the dark side of European colonization while exploring the three levels of darkness that the protagonist, Marlow, encounters: the darkness of the Congo wilderness, the darkness of the Europeans' cruel treatment of the African natives, and the unfathomable darkness within every human being for committing heinous acts of evil. Although Conrad does not give the name of the river, at the time of writing the Congo Free State, the location of the large and important Congo River, was a private colony of Belgium's King Leopold II. In the story, Marlow is employed to transport ivory downriver. However, his more pressing assignment is to return Kurtz, another ivory trader, to civilization, in a cover-up. Kurtz has a reputation throughout the region.

Bassanio, an impoverished gentleman, uses the credit of his friend, the merchant Antonio, to borrow money from a wealthy Jew, Shylock.  Antonio pledges to pay Shylock a pound of flesh if he defaults on the loan, which Bassanio will use to woo a rich heiress, Portia.  A subplot concerns the elopement of Shylock's daughter Jessica with a Christian, Bassanio's friend Lorenzo.  In its focus on love and marriage, the play shares certain concerns with Shakespeare's other comedies.  Yet its depiction of the tensions between Jews and Christians in early modern Venice - and its highly dramatic trial scene in Act 4 - create darker currents in the play.

The Wonderland described in the tale plays with logic in ways that have made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic examples of the genre of literary nonsense.

In an unprecedented act of literary pastiche and cross-over, Sherlock Holmes and Lupin actually meet, briefly in this first volume, and more substantially in the next.

Published when Tolstoy was twenty-three, the book gained immediate notice among Russian writers including Ivan Turgenev, and heralded the young Tolstoy as a major figure in Russian letters. Childhood is an expressionist exploration of the internal life of a young boy, Nikolenka, and was a new form in Russian writing, mixing fact, fiction and emotions to render the moods and reactions of the narrator. Childhood is Tolstoy's first published work. Translated into English by C. J.

Beard & Mary Ritter Beard","description":"Charles Austin Beard was the most influential American historian of the early 20th century. He published hundreds of monographs, textbooks and interpretive studies in both history and political science. He graduated from DePauw University in 1898, where he met and eventually married Mary Ritter Beard, one of the founders of the first Greek-letter society for women, Kappa Alpha Theta. Many of his books were written in collaboration with his wife, whose own interests lay in feminism and the labor union movement (Woman as a Force in History, 1946).In 1921, Charles and Mary Beard published their History of the United States. A contemporaneous review stated: \"The authors… assume enough maturity in high school students to justify a topical rather than a chronological treatment. They have dealt with movements, have sketched large backgrounds, have traced causes, and have discussed the interrelation of social and economic forces and politics. All this has been directed to the large purpose of helping the student to understand American today in all its national characteristics and as part of world civilization as well…The literary style is exceptionally clear and crisp, and the whole approach…is thought producing. As a textbook or handbook for the average citizen it ranks with very best.\" (Summary by M.L.

Read by Adrian Praetzellis.One of the greatest English tragic novels, TESS OF THE D’URBERVILLES (1891) is the story of a “pure woman” who is victimized both by conventional morality and its antithesis. Born near Dorchester, Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) set most of his stories in the region between Berkshire and Dorset in the fictional county of Wessex. He was a controversial writer whose work often showed the result of flouting the rigid Victorian moral code -- his novel JUDE THE OBSCURE was (allegedly) burned by the Bishop of Wakefield for its shocking content. Hardy was an unflinching observer and in TESS has left us some unforgettable vignettes of rural life in late 19th-century England: the slow death of a flock of wounded pheasants, the monotony of field labour under an iron gray sky, and the itinerant farm worker’s seasonal round.

Read by Darren Slider.Rome having been stormed and sacked by the Goths under Alaric their king, the worshipers of false gods, or pagans, as we commonly call them, made an attempt to attribute this calamity to the Christian religion, and began to blaspheme the true God with even more than their wonted bitterness and acerbity. It was this which kindled my zeal for the house of God, and prompted me to undertake the defense of the city of God against the charges and misrepresentations of its assailants. This work was in my hands for several years, owing to the interruptions occasioned by many other affairs which had a prior claim on my attention, and which I could not defer.However, this great undertaking was at last completed in twenty-two books. Of these, the first five refute those who fancy that the polytheistic worship is necessary in order to secure worldly prosperity, and that all these overwhelming calamities have befallen us in consequence of its prohibition. In the following five books I address myself to those who admit that such calamities have at all times attended, and will at all times attend, the human race, and that they constantly recur in forms more or less disastrous, varying only in the scenes, occasions, and persons on whom they light, but, while admitting this, maintain that the worship of the gods is advantageous for the life to come. In these ten books, then, I refute these two opinions, which are as groundless as they are antagonistic to the Christian religion.But that no one might have occasion to say, that though I had refuted the tenets of other men, I had omitted to establish my own, I devote to this object the second part of this work, which comprises twelve books, although I have not scrupled, as occasion offered, either to advance my own opinions in the first ten books, or to demolish the arguments of my opponents in the last twelve. Of these twelve books, the first four contain an account of the origin of these two cities—the city of God, and the city of the world. The second four treat of their history or progress; the third and last four, of their deserved destinies. And so, though all these twenty-two books refer to both cities, yet I have named them after the better city, and called them The City of God.

1916). His witty, biting and occasionally odd short stories satirised Edwardian culture. Saki is considered a master of the short story and has been compared to O. Henry and Dorothy Parker as well as Noel Coward and Oscar Wilde (who clearly influenced Saki).His first collection of short stories, Reginald, was published by Methuen Press in 1904 though these stories first appeared in the ‘Westminster Gazette’. The stories in this collection are a foil for allowing the jaded and insider/outsider figure of Reginald to comment on some ridiculous or provincial attitudes prevalent in upper class Edwardian society, although one can easily recognize these same attitudes in our society today. Long popular and well known, Saki’s brilliant humour is as enjoyable now as it was almost a century ago.

Read in German by Karlsson Die märchenhafte Erzählung \"Undine\" ist ein charakteristisches Werk der deutschen Romantik und das wohl bekannteste Werk von Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué.  Das überaus anmutige und schöne Mädchen Undine wächst als Pflegetochter eines armen alten Fischers und dessen Frau auf einer Landzunge an einem See auf. Ein unheimlicher und verrufener Wald trennt die drei von der nahegelegenen Reichsstadt. Eines Tages verirrt sich der junge Ritter Huldbrand von Ringstetten durch den Wald zu der Fischerhütte. Er war von Bertalda, der von ihm angebeteten Pflegetochter eines Herzogs, zu einer Mutprobe nach einem Turniersieg in den Zauberwald geschickt worden. Huldbrand ist er von Undines Schönheit, aber auch von ihrem gleichzeitig kecken und geheimnisvollen Wesen ganz verzaubert. Da er wegen eines Hochwassers nicht zurück in die Reichsstadt gelangen kann, verbleibt er einige Zeit auf der Insel. Er verliebt sich in Undine, und wenig später wird das Paar von einem bei dem fortwährenden Sturm auf der Insel gestrandeten Priester getraut. Am folgenden Tag eröffnet Undine dem Huldbrand, dass sie in Wahrheit kein Mensch sei, sondern zu den Wassergeistern gehöre, nun aber durch die Heirat mit einem Menschen eine Seele erhalten habe. Huldbrand hält in Liebe weiter zu ihr, aber als nach einiger Zeit das Hochwasser endlich verschwindet und das Ehepaar zur Reichsstadt reisen kann, trifft Huldbrand dort wieder auf Bertalda; die alten Gefühle zu dieser erwachen und seine Liebe zur schönen und sanftmütigen Undine wird auf eine harte Probe gestellt. Doch ein Treuebruch Huldbrands würde nach den Gesetzen der Elementargeister für die Beteiligten ein tragisches Ende bedeuten...

Continúa con la historia del joven gaditano Gabriel de Araceli, quien es también protagonista de los dos anteriores episodios, La Corte de Carlos IV y Trafalgar. La vida de Gabriel transcurre entre idas y venidas de la capital a Aranjuez, donde su novia Inés, huérfana, vive recogida por su tío, párroco de Aranjuez y protegido del Primer Ministro Manuel de Godoy, de quien dice ser paisano y amigo. Gabriel será testigo directo del Motín de Aranjuez del 19 de Marzo. Inés es recogida contra su voluntad en casa de dos parientes de su madre, los hermanos Requejo, quienes la mantienen encerrada. Requejo sabe que Inés es hija de una rica Condesa, y pretende casarse con ella para conseguir su fortuna. Gabriel consigue trabajo en casa de Requejo para estar cerca de Inés, prometiendo liberarla de su encierro. Utilizará su ingenio y sus dotes para la intriga, desarrolladas durante su estancia en la corte (episodio segundo, La Corte de Carlos IV) y tramará un plan para sacar a Inés de casa de Requejo, embaucando a Juan de Dios, otro empleado de Requejo también enamorado de Inés.

Read in English by kirstylHenry Handel Richardson was the pseudonym of Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson, a writer who was born in 1870 to a reasonably well-off family which later fell on hard times. The author's family lived in various Victorian towns and from the age of 13 to 17 Richardson attended boarding school at the Presbyterian Ladies' College in Melbourne, Victoria. It's this experience that feeds directly into The Getting of Wisdom. Laura Tweedle Rambotham, the main character, is the eldest child of a country family. She is a clever and highly imaginative child, given to inventing romantic stories for the entertainment of her younger siblings, and an avid reader. She is also both proud and sensitive and her mother finds her difficult to handle. Her mother is the widow of a barrister who supports her family in genteel poverty on her earnings from embroidery. At the age of twelve Laura is sent off to boarding school in Melbourne. Her experiences at school shock and humiliate the unworldly Laura. The girls at the school are generally from rather wealthy families and those, like Laura, who come from less fortunate backgrounds learn very early not to divulge their circumstances for fear of ridicule. From time to time Laura lets little snippets of information about her family slip out, and she suffers for it.

Read in English by Marcelle D Ward; Celine Major A family celebrates Christmas and its flaws are gently exposed by the house guest Mrs. Parry. Giles is engaged to the wealthy Daisy, yet is clearly in love with the governess Anne Denham. Things come to a head when Daisy is murdered. Who would murder her? Perhaps the governess who told her she would kill her and made it clear she wanted to exchange places with her? After all the governess ran away with a mysterious man right after the murder and was not seen again. Or did someone frame the governess? Perhaps it is Mr. Morley, Daisy's guardian, who wanted her money? Or perhaps someone else? After all, Daisy was not popular in the village. Giles, bent on saving the woman he loves, and the detective Mr. Steel go to investigate. This is a detective story in the traditional sense, but it is a host of other things. It is a very strong love story, a story about class and how it influences people's choices, a story about greed, and much more. - Summary by Stav Nisser.

Queen Lucia (first published in 1920) was the first of Benson’s ‘Mapp and Lucia’ novels of which there were six. This first book is a comedy of manners based in the provincial village of Riseholme, where Emmeline Lucas (the Queen Lucia of the title) presides over the social and artistic universe of the gullible residents. Her aide-de-camp in these matters is the somewhat effete Georgie Pillson and the chief competitor for her ‘crown’ is Daisy Quantock. The scandal of the Guru, the psychical goings on with Princess Popoffski and the arrival into the sleepy village of a famous Prima Donna all conspire to threaten her supremacy… (summary by Martin Clifton)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (135MB)Download M4B Part 2 (101MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800209.us.archive.org/5/items/queen_lucia_librivox/Queen_Lucia_1107.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-12-06 17:43:03","Boxid":"OL100020204","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-13T04:44:13Z","Identifier":"queen_lucia_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"8:45:06","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"Chapter 01","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_01_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 02","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_02_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 03","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_03_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 04","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_04_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 05","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_05_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 06","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_06_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 07","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_07_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 08","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_08_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 09","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_09_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 10","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_10_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 11","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_11_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 12","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_12_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 13","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_13_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 14","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_14_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 15","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_15_benson.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 16","source":"https://archive.org/download/queen_lucia_librivox/queen_lucia_16_benson.mp3"}]},{"title":"Typee","author":"Herman Melville","description":"Librivox recording of Typee, by Herman Melville.Read by Michael SchererTypee is Melville's first novel, based on his actual experiences after having jumped ship in the Marquesas Islands. Extremely popular at the time of its initial publication, it provoked disbelief among its readers until the events it described were corroborated by Melville's fellow castaway, Richard T. Greene, who appears in the story as the character Toby. While the book is factually based, Melville exercised his artistic license so much that Typee is properly considered a work of fiction: the three week stay on which he based his story is extended in the narrative to four months, and he drew extensively on contemporary accounts by Pacific explorers to add cultural detail to what might otherwise have been a straightforward story of escape, capture and re-escape.

Recording by Marian Martín.\n\nEl Libro de la Vida se redactó en periodos sucesivos y con finalidades distintas, aunque el periodo de redacción definitivo suele situarse entre 1562-1566. La Santa lo escribió por mandato y bajo la dirección de sus confesores, e iba dirigido a un círculo religioso reducido. El Libro comprende hasta sus 50 años de edad y lo escribe durante una de las etapas más difíciles de su vida. En los primeros capítulos Santa Teresa aporta gran cantidad de información autobiográfica sobre su vida familiar, su infancia, y su ingreso en la vida religiosa. A lo largo del libro hay otros episodios de este tipo: sus referencias al Santo fray Pedro de Alcántara, a quien conoció personalmente, y el proceso que le llevó a la fundación del primer monasterio reformado de San José de Avila, se encuentran entre las más memorables. Pero en su mayor parte el Libro de la Vida narra su progreso espiritual y sus vivencias místicas, así como su práctica y concepción de la oración, escrito en su particular estilo analítico y enormemente sincero. Por esto se ha calificado a la obra como “autobiografía introspectiva”. Esta obra, como todos los escritos de la Santa, están entre las más sobresalientes tesoros de la literatura mística de la Iglesia Católica. (Resumen: Marian Martín).The Autobiography was written in different stages and probably with varying intentions, but the final version was produced in 1562-1566. The Saint wrote it under the direction of her confessors, and it was intended for a small religious circle. The work covers her life until the age of 50, and was written during one of the most difficult periods of her life. In the first chapters Saint Theresa presents a good deal of autobiographic information about her family, her childhood, and how she entered the religious life. Interspersed throughout the book are other episodes of this type: her descriptions of Saint Peter of Alcantara, whom she knew personally, and the process that led to the foundation of the first reformed monastery of Saint Joseph in Avila, are among the most memorable. But for the most part the Autobiography describes her spiritual progress and mystical experiences, as well as her views and practice of prayer, written in her analytical and highly sincere style. For this reason the work has been called “an introspective autobiography”. It stands, as do all her other works, among the most remarkable treasures of the mystical literature of the Catholic Church.

recording of The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. Read by LibriVox volunteers.The Woman in White is an epistolary novel written by Wilkie Collins in 1859, serialized in 1859-1860, and first published in book form in 1860. It is considered to be to the first mystery novel, and is widely regarded as one of the first (and finest) in the genre of ’sensation novels’….The Woman in White is also an early example of a particular type of Collins narrative in which several characters in turn take up the telling of the story. This creates a complex web in which readers are unsure which narrator can, and cannot, be trusted. Collins used this technique in his other novels, including The Moonstone. This technique was copied by other novelists, including Bram Stoker, author of Dracula (1897), although by the end of the 19th century the technique was considered “old-fashioned”.

recording of Monte-Cristo's Daughter by Edmund Flagg.  Read in English by Jim Locke \"Monte-Cristo's Daughter,\" a wonderfully brilliant, original, exciting and absorbing novel, is the Sequel to \"The Count of Monte-Cristo,\" Alexander Dumas' masterwork, and the continuation and conclusion of that great romance, \"Edmond Dantès.\" It possesses rare power, unflagging interest and an intricate plot that for constructive skill and efficient development stands unrivalled. Zuleika, the beautiful daughter of Monte-Cristo and Haydée, is the heroine, and her suitor, the Viscount Giovanni Massetti, an ardent, impetuous young Roman, the hero. The latter, through a flirtation with a pretty flower-girl, Annunziata Solara, becomes involved in a maze of suspicion that points to him as an abductor and an assassin, causes his separation from Zuleika and converts him into a maniac. The straightening out of these tangled complications constitutes the main theme of the thrilling book. The novel abounds in ardent love scenes and stirring adventures. The Count of Monte-Cristo figures largely in it, and numerous Monte-Cristo characters are introduced.

Der Roman ist vorgeblich ein Erlebnisbericht des französischen Professors Pierre Aronnax, Autor eines Werkes über „Die Geheimnisse der Meerestiefen“. Auf einer Expedition zur Klärung einer Reihe rätselhafter Schiffsunglücke, die von einem Unterwasserfahrzeug oder Seeungeheuer gekentert worden sein sollen, wird das fragliche Objekt gesichtet. Im Verlauf der anschließenden Verfolgungsjag werden Aronnax, sein Diener Conseil und der kanadische Harpunier Ned Land ins offene Meer gespült, finden aber letztlich auf der Oberfläche des vermeintlichen Seeungeheuers festen Boden unter den Füßen. Es stellt sich heraus, dass es sich tatsächlich um ein eisenbeschlagenes Unterseeboot handelt. Nach einiger Zeit öffnet sich eine Luke und die drei Männer werden von Mannschaftsangehörigen des Gefährts in eine Zelle geführt, später dem Kapitän vorgeführt, der sich dann als „Nemo“ − lateinisch für „Niemand“ – vorstellt. Mit der Zeit erfährt Aronnax in Gesprächen mit dem mysteriösen Nemo Details über die technischen Fähigkeiten des Unterseeboots, der Nautilus, jedoch kaum etwas über ihren Kapitän und ihre Mannschaft. Die drei Gestrandeten sind gezwungen, an Bord der Nautilus eine Weltreise unter Wasser mitzumachen, und erleben allerlei Abenteuer; sie kämpfen gegen einen Riesenkraken und einen Hai, sehen die Ruinen des versunkenen Atlantis und sind an Bord, als Kapitän Nemo mit seiner Nautilus als erster Mensch den Südpol erreicht.

In the words of the authors, \"It is designed in these pages to bring the reader face to face with Edison; to glance at an interesting childhood and a youthful period marked by a capacity for doing things, and by an insatiable thirst for knowledge; then to accompany him into the great creative stretch of forty years, during which he has done so much. This book shows him plunged deeply into work for which he has always had an incredible capacity, reveals the exercise of his unsurpassed inventive ability, his keen reasoning powers, his tenacious memory, his fertility of resource; follows him through a series of innumerable experiments, conducted methodically, reaching out like rays of search-light into all the regions of science and nature, and finally exhibits him emerging triumphantly from countless difficulties bearing with him in new arts the fruits of victorious struggle.\"(Summary by Justin Barrett, with authors' quote taken from the work itself)Read by Librivox volunteers.For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B part 1 (136MB)Download M4B part 2 (142MB)Download M4B part 3 (143MB)Download M4B part 4 (123MB)Download M4B part 5 (143MB)Download M4B part 6 (135MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800706.us.archive.org/7/items/edison_his_life_0809_librivox/edison_his_life_and_inventions_1012.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2008-09-03 12:25:28","Boxid":"OL100020209","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-15T23:39:47Z","Identifier":"edison_his_life_0809_librivox","Runtime":"29:41:34","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2008          ","audios":[{"title":"00 -

Marx's aim in Capital, Volume I is to uncover and explain the laws specific to the capitalist mode of production and of the class struggles rooted in these capitalist social relations of production. Marx said himself that his aim was \"to bring a science [i.e. political economy] by criticism to the point where it can be dialectically represented\", and in this way to \"reveal the law of motion of modern society\". By showing how capitalist development was the precursor of a new, socialist mode of production, he aimed to provide a scientific foundation for the modern labour movement. In preparation for his book, he studied the economic literature available in his time for a period of twelve years, mainly in the British Museum in London.

Anna awakes from a loveless marriage to find herself drawn irresistibly to the dashing cavalry officer, Count Vronsky. Levin struggles with self-esteem, and even flees to the country, before gaining courage to return and offer himself to the beautiful and pure Kitty. Through troubled courtships, reconciliations, marriage and the birth of each one’s first child, Anna and Levin experience joy and despair as they each struggle to find their place in the world and meaning for their lives.
