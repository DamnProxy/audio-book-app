Read by Denny Sayers.Daniel Defoe's The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner (1719) is considered by many the first English novel. Based on the real-life experiences of the castaway Alexander Selkirk, the book has had a perrenial appeal among readers of all ages - especially the young adult reading public - who continue to find inspiration in the inventive resourcefulness of its hero, sole survivor of a shipwreck who is marooned on an uninhabited island.Especially poignant, after more than two decades of unbroken solitude, is the affection that Robinson develops for Friday, another survivor fleeing certain death at the hands of enemy tribesmen from the South American continent.

The novel is nominally about the obsessive hunt by the crazed Captain Ahab of the book's eponymous white whale. But interspersed in that story are digressions, paradoxes, philosophical riffs on whaling and life, and a display of techniques so advanced for its time that some have referred to the 1851 Moby Dick as the first \"modern\" novel.

Translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.    The Divine Comedy (Italian: Commedia, later christened “Divina” by Giovanni Boccaccio), written by Dante Alighieri between 1308 and his death in 1321, is widely considered the central epic poem of Italian literature, the last great work of literature of the Middle Ages and the first great work of the Renaissance. A culmination of the medieval world-view of the afterlife, it establishes the Tuscan dialect in which it is written as the Italian standard, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature.The Divine Comedy is composed of three canticas (or “cantiche”) — Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise) — composed each of 33 cantos (or “canti”). The very first canto serves as an introduction to the poem and is generally not considered to be part of the first cantica, bringing the total number of cantos to 100.The poet tells in the first person his travel through the three realms of the dead, lasting during the Easter Triduum in the spring of 1300.For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit LibriVox.org.

Read by Ruth Golding.A collection of twelve short stories featuring Conan Doyle's legendary detective, originally published as single stories in Strand Magazine and subsequently collected into a single volume.There is not always a crime committed nor a culprit to find, and when there is, Holmes does not invariably get his man. However, his extraordinary powers of deduction generally solve the mystery, often to the discomfiture of the official police force. Holmes is a man of many facets, and I do not share the common perception of Holmes as cold and humourless: his sense of fun can be sparkling, and there are moments of rare pathos.

The story begins as the Invisible Man, with a bandaged face and a heavy coat and gloves, takes a train to lodge in a country inn whilst he tries to discover the antidote and make himself visible again.

Walden by Henry David Thoreau Read by Gord Mackenzie.Walden by Henry David Thoreau is one of the best-known non-fiction books written by an American. Published in 1854, it details Thoreau’s life for two years, two months, and two days around the shores of Walden Pond. Walden is neither a novel nor a true autobiography, but a social critique of the Western World, with each chapter heralding some aspect of humanity that needed to be either renounced or praised. Along with his critique of the civilized world, Thoreau examines other issues afflicting man in society, ranging from economy and reading to solitude and higher laws. He also takes time to talk about the experience at Walden Pond itself, commenting on the animals and the way people treated him for living there, using those experiences to bring out his philosophical positions. This extended commentary on nature has often been interpreted as a strong statement to the natural religion that transcendentalists like Thoreau and Emerson were preaching.

The first half was published in serial form between 1881 and 1883, and then completed as a book for children in February 1883. It is about the mischievous adventures of Pinocchio, an animated marionette, and his poor father, a woodcarver named Geppetto. It is considered a classic of children's literature and has spawned many derivative works of art, such as Disney's classic 1940 animated movie of the same name, and commonplace ideas, such as a liar's

Read by Annie Coleman. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) by Mark Twain is one of the truly great American novels, beloved by children, adults, and literary critics alike. The book tells the story of \"Huck\" Finn (first introduced as Tom Sawyer's sidekick in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer), his friend Jim, and their journey down the Mississippi River on a raft. Both are on the run, Huck from his drunk and abusive father, and Jim as a runaway slave.As Huck and Jim drift down the river, they meet many colorful characters and have many great adventures. The true heart of the story, however, is the friendship between Huck and Jim. A constant theme throughout the book is Huck's internal struggle between what he has been taught, that helping a runaway slave is a sin, and what he truly believes, that Jim is a good man and it couldn't possibly be wrong to help him.Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was unique at the time of its publication (1884) because it is narrated by Huck himself and is written in the numerous dialects common in the area and time in which the book is set. Although the book was originally intended as a sequel to the children's book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, as Twain wrote Adventures of Huckleberry Finn it progressed into a more serious work. Twain's views on slavery and other social issues of the time become clear through the words, thoughts, and actions of Huck Finn. The book has always been the subject of great controversy, and according to The American Library Association it was fifth on the list of most frequently challenged books in the 1990s.(Summary by Annie Coleman) For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Read by Karen Savage.Pride and Prejudice is the most famous of Jane Austen’s novels, and its opening is one of the most famous lines in English literature - “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” Its manuscript was first written between 1796 and 1797, and was initially called First Impressions, but was never published under that title. Following revisions it was published on 28 January 1813 by the same Mr. Egerton of the Military Library, Whitehall, who had brought out Sense and Sensibility. Like both its predecessor and Northanger Abbey, it was written at Steventon Rectory.

Prejudice, by Jane Austen. Read by Elizabeth Klett.Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's classic comic romance, in which the five Bennett sisters try to find that most elusive creature: a single man in possession of a large fortune.  Sparks fly when sweet, pretty Jane meets their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley, but her sister Elizabeth is most offended by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy.  This is Austen at the height of her powers: the ironic narration, hilariously drawn supporting characters, and romantic suspense make this her most enduringly popular novel.

Smith.    The Swiss Family Robinson has delighted generations of readers with its exciting tale of a family which, though shipwrecked, displays “the right stuff” and builds a charming colony that later, they do not want to leave. Cut off from the comforts and companionship of other humans, they use a familiarity with natural history and biology to find the resources and build the tools to construct a canoe, weave cloth, irrigate a garden, and turn an immense hollow tree into a lofty house with a spiral staircase. They domesticate buffaloes, wild asses, and monkeys. They establish farms and plantations. And finally, they have a terrifying encounter with natives from a nearby island.    Johann David Wyss, the author, did not live to complete his tale. Storytellers over the years have injected so many episodes into the various versions that probably none closely match the original. (Indeed, the Baroness de Montholieu expanded the book from two volumes into five when she translated it into French.) This effort was re-translated into English in 1849 by W.H.G. Kingston, abridging the edition severely. It follows the British sensibilities of the period in terms of sentence structure and emphasis. (Summary by Mark F.

Mark Twain's lively tale of the scrapes and adventures of boyhood is set in St. Petersburg, Missouri, where Tom Sawyer and his friend Huckleberry Finn have the kinds of adventures many boys can imagine: racing bugs during class, impressing girls, with fights and stunts in the schoolyard, getting lost in a cave, and playing pirates on the Mississippi river.\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\nTo see a beautiful scan of Tom Sawyer, see this version in the Internet Archive's American Libraries collection.\n\nFor further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.\n\nFor more information or to volunteer, please visit LibriVox.org.\n\nDownload M4B Part 1 32kbps (26MB)\nDownload M4B Part 2 32kbps (23MB)\nDownload M4B Part 1 64kbps (100MB)\nDownload M4B Part 2 64kbps (89MB)\n","cover":"https://ia902607.us.archive.org/31/items/tom_sawyer_librivox/tom_sawyer2.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-05-01 01:15:37","Boxid":"OL100020312","External-identifer":"urn:librivox_id:tom-sawyer-by-mark-twain","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-28T00:13:28Z","Identifier":"tom_sawyer_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Run time":"6:46:12","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Taped by":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"Chapter 01-02","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_01-02_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 03-04","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_03-04_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 05-06","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_05-06_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 07-08","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_07-08_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 09-10","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_09-10_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 11-12","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_11-12_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 13-15","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_13-14-15_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 16-17","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_16-17_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 18-20","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_18-19-20_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 21-23","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_21-22-23_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 24-25","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_24-25_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 26","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_26_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 27-28","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_27-28_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 29","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_29_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 30","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_30_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 31-32","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_31-32_twain.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 33-35","source":"https://archive.org/download/tom_sawyer_librivox/TSawyer_33-34-35_twain.mp3"}]},{"title":"Pride and Prejudice (version 2)","author":"Jane Austen","description":"Librivox recording of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen.Read by Annie Coleman.Jane Austen's classic novel chronicles the events in the lives of the Bennet family.

by Homer (transl. Samuel Butler).The Odyssey is one of the two major ancient Greek epic poems (the other being the Iliad), attributed to the poet Homer. The poem is commonly dated to between 800 and 600 BC. The poem is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, and concerns the events that befall the Greek hero Odysseus in his long journey back to his native land Ithaca after the fall of Troy.It takes Odysseus ten years to return to his native land of Ithaca after ten years of war; during his 20-year absence, his son Telemachus and his wife Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors who have moved into Odysseus’ home to compete for Penelope’s hand in marriage, since most have assumed that Odysseus has died.The poem is a fundamental text in the Western canon and continues to be read in both Homeric Greek and translations around the world.(Summary from Wikipedia)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (167MB)Download M4B Part 2 (161MB)Oct 26, 2012 - Normalized volumes on files to fix large volume discrepancies.\n","cover":"https://ia802307.us.archive.org/30/items/odyssey_butler_librivox/The_Odyssey_1005.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-03-12 10:28:07","Boxid":"OL100020216","Identifier":"odyssey_butler_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Run time":"11:18:25","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Taped by":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 01","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_01_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 02","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_02_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 03","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_03_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 04","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_04_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 05","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_05_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 06","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_06_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 07","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_07_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 08","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_08_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 09","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_09_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 10","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_10_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 11","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_11_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 12","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_12_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 13","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_13_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 14","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_14_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 15","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_15_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 16","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_16_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 17","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_17_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 18","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_18_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 19","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_19_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 20","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_20_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 21","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_21_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 22","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_22_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 23","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_23_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 24","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_24_homer_butler.mp3"}]},{"title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (version 02)","author":"Mark Twain","description":"LibriVox recording of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (version 02).  Read by Mark F. Smith.In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain creates an entertaining adventure of Middle America in the 1800's - afloat on a raft on the Mississippi River. Huck escapes his civilized life when he arranges his own \"murder\" and turns back into the backwoods, downriver yokel he started as, and in the process springing a slave, Jim, from bondage.Huck and Jim experience life as a series of tableaus as the river sweeps them through small towns on their way South. At each stop, Huck engages his talent for mixing fact with bald-faced lies to endlessly get himself out of situations... and of course, putting him into others!Much has been written about the statement Twain is making about slavery in this book, but it's really secondary to the story. The facts of how black people were treated in this period give Huck and Jim their license for life on the run. Modern listeners will be intrigued by the unencumbered life of the pair; they make do with coffee, fish from the river, and little else (but of course, when they do need something extra, they don't mind helping themselves to it without recourse to money!)Huck and Jim have run-ins with desperados and family feuds and even manage to get run down by a steamboat. The adventures ratchet up when they are joined on the raft by a self-proclaimed \"duke\" and a \"king\" - shysters both, who spend their time in figuring how to fleece the public in the little river towns. And when Jim is captured and threatened with being sent back into slavery, Huck enlists his old buddy Tom Sawyer in a frenzied, desperate, and terribly funny rescue.I had to clip a lot of laughing from this recording at Twain's sly, catch-'em-when-they're-not-looking humor, but you can feel free to enjoy some good belly laughs at this crew of lovable rapscallions!

It is widely held to be one of Dickens’ finest and most complete novels, containing one of the most vast, complex and engaging arrays of minor characters and sub-plots in his entire canon. Dickens tells all of these both through the narrative of the novel’s heroine, Esther Summerson, and as an omniscient narrator. Memorable characters include the menacing lawyer Tulkinghorn, the friendly but depressive John Jarndyce and the childish Harold Skimpole. The plot concerns a long-running legal dispute (Jarndyce and Jarndyce) which has far-reaching consequences for all involved.(Summary from Wikipedia)For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B part 1 (228MB)Download M4B part 2 (208MB)Download M4B part 3 (233MB)Download M4B part 4 (182MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800709.us.archive.org/13/items/bleak_house_cl_librivox/Bleak_House_1003.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2008-01-23 05:04:58","Boxid":"OL100020109","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-27T05:32:31Z","Identifier":"bleak_house_cl_librivox","Run time":"43:30:19","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Taped by":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2008          ","audios":[{"title":"01 -

Smith. This classic tale tells of an orphan, Pip, who through a series of strange circumstances first finds a trade as a blacksmith's apprentice and then learns that he has \"great expectations\" of a future inheritance from an anonymous benefactor. He soon learns to live the profligate life of a gentleman as he gradually sheds his associations with the gentle souls of his past, Joe (the blacksmith) and Biddy (a level-headed young lady). He throws his money at improving the prospects of his roommate and friend Herbert and his heart at an \"ice princess\" whose heart will never respond. But then an escaped convict from his distant past comes calling, and all Pip's hopes dissolve. (Summary by Mark F.

Stowe","description":"Librivox recording of Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe.Read by John Greenman.Among the most \"banned\" books in the United States, Uncle Tom’s Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly is a novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe which treats slavery as a central theme. Stowe was a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active abolitionist. The novel is believed to have had a profound effect on the North’s view of slavery. In fact, when he met Harriet Beecher Stowe, President Lincoln is said to have commented, \"So you're the little lady whose book started the Civil War.\" First published on March 20, 1852, the story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave, the central character around whose life the other characters—both fellow slaves and slave owners—revolve. The novel depicts the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that Christian love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings. (Summary by Wikipedia and John Greenman)Note From the Reader: The listener is about to enter a world rich with diverse characters. In order to differentiate between the characters, the reader has given each, his/her own voice. As an adult male reader, however, the reader’s representation of women and children will, necessarily be less than adequate. He asks for your indulgence.

It is often considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas's most popular work. The writing of the work was completed in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815–1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. It is primarily concerned with themes of justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness, and is told in the style of an adventure story.
